          "evidence": "In the Project Narrative, CSHC states: 'In August 2023, CSHC contracted Health Resources in Action (HRiA), a non-profit public health organization in Boston, to lead the development of the 2023 community health needs assessment (CHNA). The 2023 CHNA was undertaken to ensure that CSHC is addressing the most pressing health concerns among residents of its primary service area of Dorchester, MA. ... Our last CHNA performed in 2023 was conducted by Health Resources in Action (HRiA)... Our next CHNA will be undertaken in 2026 calendar year.' The application further describes the use of multiple data sources, including UDS, Boston Public Health Commission, Massachusetts Health Policy Commission, and Massachusetts League of Community Health Centers, and details how the needs assessment informs service delivery, strategic planning, and community engagement. The application also describes annual review of the service area and ongoing assessment of unmet need.",

There is also evidence of annual review and ongoing monitoring of patient needs and service area changes. Therefore, the application is COMPLIANT with Element b - Update of Needs Assessment.",
