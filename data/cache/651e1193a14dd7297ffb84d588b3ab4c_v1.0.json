          "evidence": "In the application narrative, under '5. Community Needs Assessment and Input', it states: 'FPCSN policy requires that an assessment of the needs of the target population and the service area communities will be conducted at least every three years and will be used by management and the Board for strategic planning.' The application further details the sources of data (Census, state and local studies, statistical analysis, and community relationships) and describes the process for gathering and using needs assessment data. The narrative also states, 'Formal needs assessments are done at least every three years, as well as when a new service or site is proposed either internally or by an external partner such as the Housing Authority, the PHA Tenants' Council, or the School District.' The needs assessment includes recent data (2023-2025) on population, poverty, health status, barriers, and special populations (e.g., public housing residents). The application references the last SAC application (October 2024) and describes annual reviews of patient origin and ongoing updates. The operational plan (Attachment 12) and compliance attachment (Attachment 13) both confirm the triennial needs assessment policy and its use in strategic planning.",

The application provides specific examples of how the needs assessment is conducted, updated, and used in planning and quality improvement.

          "evidence": "The SF-424A, Budget Narrative, and Form 3 - Income Analysis all include detailed breakdowns of revenue sources. The SF-424A Section A and Budget Narrative list the following revenue sources: Federal (HRSA) award, other federal ($218,000), state ($125,000), private grants/contracts ($160,000), 340B revenue ($13,770,000), and program income ($16,277,538), with a total budget of $34,891,923. Form 3 further breaks down program income by payer (Medicaid, Medicare, Private, Self-Pay). The Budget Narrative and Form 3 both show that all revenue sources are included in the annual budget, not just the HRSA award. The application narrative also states: 'FPCSN is operated in a way that maximizes non-grant revenue and leverages other resources, particularly patient service fees and 340B funds, for health center operations. The percentage of federal grant dollars in the overall budget has always been reasonable and was 19% of the budget in the most recent year.'",
