Many of the findings from our most recent needs assessment (completed in July 2024) are cited throughout the Need section above.' The narrative also describes use of the most recent UDS data (2024), county and state data, and references to external needs assessments (Onondaga County Community Needs Assessment and CHA), both conducted every three years. The application details how the needs assessment informs planning, service delivery, and strategic decisions, including recent expansions (e.g., portable clinic for homeless individuals, new residency program).",
