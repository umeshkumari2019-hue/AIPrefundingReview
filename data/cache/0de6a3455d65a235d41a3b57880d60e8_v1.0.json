External assessment involves a review of needs assessments, market analysis, and identification of environmental factors with potential to impact health center performance. As part of the community needs assessment, HRSA's Service Area Needs Assessment Methodology (SANAM) generates the service area's Unmet Needs Score (UNS)...' In Section 'Needs Assessment, Scope of Project, and Patient/Community Input', it further states: 'LSCC reviews and updates its Needs Assessment annually, incorporating state and local census, demographic, and health assessment data to gain perspective on the forces impacting health care in Central Texas.' The needs assessment includes recent data (2023-2025) from Census, UDS, GeoCare Navigator, Texas Department of State Health Services, and local health authorities. The application provides detailed tables and narrative analysis of population growth, poverty, insurance status, health disparities, and special populations (e.g., Hispanic, rural, children, seniors).
