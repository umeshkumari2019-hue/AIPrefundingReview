The sliding fee discount program is described as being board-approved, with policies and procedures referenced in Attachment 10 (Sliding Fee Discount Schedule), and the Board's role is confirmed in the Bylaws (Article III, Section 3.16).

HHM Health attests (Form 8) that it does NOT have such contracts. However, a review of the staffing profile (Form 2) and Form 5A confirms that the majority of required health services are provided directly by HHM Health staff, not by contract. Therefore, while the evidence supports that no such contracts exist, the requirement is technically not met because there is no documentation of HRSA approval—but this is because no such arrangement exists. This is a technical non-compliance due to the absence of a required action, but in practice, it is compliant with the intent. For the purposes of strict compliance review, it is marked non-compliant due to lack of explicit HRSA approval documentation, but the risk is low.",
