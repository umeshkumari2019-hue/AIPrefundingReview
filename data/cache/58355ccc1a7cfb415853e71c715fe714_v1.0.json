The assessment is compiled by WellSpan Health, and accounts for all four (4) counties in our service area (Adams, Lancaster, Lebanon, and York). The previous assessment was released in 2022. The assessment leverages data from multiple data sources, including: WellSpan Health patient data, WellSpan Health's provider survey; local, state and national data sources; representative and special populations community survey; and special populations data collection. Family First Health is one of many partners in the process led by our largest regional health system, WellSpan. The data collection and analysis process takes place every three years, with actions to address identified areas of improvement taking place on an ongoing basis.' The narrative further details how the needs assessment is used to inform service delivery, resource allocation, and planning, and references annual review of UDS data, zip code analysis, and patient/community input. The application also describes use of the 2025 WellSpan CHNA and 2025 UPMC CHNA, both updated every three years, and provides specific data from these assessments throughout the needs assessment section.",
