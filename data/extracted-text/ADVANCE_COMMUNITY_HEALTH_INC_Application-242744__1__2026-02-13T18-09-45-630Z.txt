[TEXT] Wake County represents one of the most urbanized and rapidly growing regions in North Carolina, home to Raleigh, the state capital, and part of the Research Triangle Park. Population growth, density, and economic expansion have created increasing demand for affordable, accessible health services - particularly among low-income and uninsured residents. Between 2010 and 2020, Wake County's population increased by more than 25%, with continuing growth projected through 2030. Source(s): Carolina Demography; University of North Carolina, 2022.

[TEXT] Franklin County, by contrast, is a smaller, rural county northeast of Wake. With limited transportation infrastructure - only two major U.S. highways - residents face barriers in reaching health care services. Many Franklin County residents commute to Wake County for employment, education, and care, highlighting the importance of ACH's integrated service delivery across county lines. The county's health system capacity is limited, with higher poverty rates and fewer providers per capita than the state average.

[TEXT] Population Profile. The total service area population is 1,246,256, reflecting a 27.6% increase since 2010. Approximately 94% of residents live in Wake County, while Franklin County - though smaller shows concentrated need related to poverty, chronic disease, and transportation. The target population, defined as individuals living below 200% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG), totals 254,844 residents (20.5%) of the service area population.

[TEXT] The shortage of health care professionals and lack of access to care across the Franklin-Wake County service area continues to demonstrate the significant unmet medical, dental, and behavioral health needs among residents.

[TEXT] In Franklin County, the population-to-primary care physician ratio is 14,910:1, more than 10 times higher than the state ratio of 1,410:1 and the national ratio of 1,310:1. Access to dental care is equally limited, with a population-to-dentist ratio of 8,560:1 compared to 1,610:1 statewide. Mental health shortages are also acute, with a ratio of 720:1 - more than twice the state average of 290:1.

[TEXT] By comparison, Wake County, which includes the urban Raleigh area, has significantly greater provider density, with a 1,150:1 population-to-primary care physician ratio, 1,320:1 for dentists, and 220:1 for mental health providers. However, even in Wake County, low-income and uninsured residents continue to face barriers to timely and affordable care, particularly in high-need zip codes and among underinsured populations.

[TEXT] Together, these indicators underscore the persistent disparities in health care access between rural Franklin County and the more urbanized Wake County. The data aligns with current HPSA designations identifying Franklin County as a shortage area for primary care, dental, and mental health services. These shortages contribute to longer wait times, higher rates of preventable hospitalizations, and reduced continuity of care - particularly for low-income, uninsured, and vulnerable residents who rely on ACH as their safety net provider.

[TEXT] ACH's ongoing focus on these areas is critical to addressing the deep-rooted social and economic barriers that limit access to care. By providing affordable, comprehensive primary and preventive services, ACH plays a vital role in improving health equity, fostering community stability, and supporting long-term economic revitalization across both Franklin and Wake Counties.

[TEXT] c. How the boundaries of the service area ensure that services are available and accessible to the residents of the area.

[TEXT] ACH defines its service area boundaries to align with the geographic regions where the greatest concentrations of medically underserved residents live, work, and seek care. The service area reflects the locations of ACH's clinical sites, the transportation patterns of patients, and the distribution of populations experiencing the highest levels of health disparities.

[TEXT] · Geographic Alignment: The boundaries encompass neighborhoods and counties designated as MUA and HPSA, ensuring ACH services are targeted to communities with the greatest unmet need.

[TEXT] · Proximity to Care: Clinical sites are strategically located within residential communities, near public transportation routes, and in areas accessible to patients traveling from rural areas. This ensures that residents can reach services without undue travel burden.

[TEXT] . Population Reach: The service area boundary captures both urban and rural populations that rely on ACH as their primary health care home. It includes low-income families, agricultural workers, and uninsured or underinsured individuals who face significant barriers to accessing private or specialty care.

[TEXT] · Accessibility Supports: Enabling services - including transportation assistance, care management, and translation - extend access to patients throughout the service area, ensuring that geography does not prevent residents from obtaining care. ACH also extends access through telehealth visits and after- hours on-call coverage, ensuring 24/7 access to clinical guidance.

[TEXT] By intentionally defining the service area to match population need, transportation access, and site placement, ACH ensures that comprehensive, patient-centered services are available and accessible to all residents within its service area boundaries.

[TEXT] d. How the overlap of political subdivisions, school districts, and areas served by Federal and State health and social programs affect access to primary health care services in the service area.

[TEXT] ACH serves a defined service area where political subdivisions, school districts, and state and federal health and social programs often overlap. These overlaps present both opportunities and challenges in ensuring equitable access to primary health care.

[TEXT] · Political Subdivisions: The service area includes multiple counties and municipalities with varying levels of public health infrastructure, transportation options, and funding priorities. Differences in local government resources can create uneven access to care; ACH mitigates this by ensuring consistent services across its clinical sites and providing enabling services such as transportation coordination and care management.

[TEXT] . School Districts: The presence of multiple school districts across the service area creates opportunities for ACH to extend pediatric and adolescent services, including school-based health initiatives, immunization partnerships, and health education. However, variations in district-level funding and resources can affect the availability of school health staff, reinforcing ACH's role as a trusted partner in ensuring children and adolescents receive preventive and primary care services.

[TEXT] . Federal and State Health and Social Programs: The service area includes populations eligible for Medicaid, Medicare, WIC, SNAP, and housing assistance programs. Program requirements, eligibility thresholds, and availability of services may vary by county or administering agency, creating complexity for patients. ACH helps patients navigate these systems through benefits counseling, application support, and referrals, ensuring that they can maximize available resources to support their health.

[TEXT] Overall, these overlaps reinforce the importance of ACH's coordinated, patient-centered model of care. By working across political boundaries, partnering with multiple school systems, and integrating with state and federal social service programs, ACH reduces fragmentation and ensures that all residents in the service area can access comprehensive, high-quality primary care, regardless of where they live or which jurisdiction they fall under.

[TEXT] e. How you will annually review the proposed service area to identify where your patients reside, available health resources, and unmet need.

[TEXT] ACH conducts an annual review of its service area to ensure alignment between where patients reside, the availability of local health resources, and emerging areas of unmet need. Following submission of the annual Uniform Data System (UDS) report, ACH analyzes patient origin data by ZIP code to determine where the majority of patients live. These ZIP codes are then compared with those listed on Form 5B: Service Sites to confirm accuracy and completeness.

[TEXT] If any ZIP code representing at least 75% of ACH's total patient population is not reflected on Form 5B, ACH identifies the service site serving those patients and submits a Change in Scope request to add the ZIP code to that site. For this application, ACH also reviewed the Service Area Announcement Table (SAAT) to verify that all ZIP codes where at least 75% of patients reside are accurately represented on Form 5B.

[TEXT] Beyond ensuring scope accuracy, this annual review helps ACH monitor population shifts, evaluate areas experiencing growth or increased demand, and identify emerging service gaps. This analysis informs strategic planning, site development, and resource allocation to ensure that ACH continues to effectively meet the health care needs of residents throughout its service area. ACH is a sponsoring partner with Wake County's Community Health Needs Assessment group and uses information from the CHNA to inform services offered, hours of operation, and other identified needs.

[TEXT] f. If your urban/rural selection on Form 1A is different from the service area type listed for the proposed service area on the SAAT, explain why, including data sources.

[TEXT] g. Competing continuation applicants: Using Uniform Data System (UDS) data, describe changes to the service area since your last Service Area Competition (SAC) application.

[TEXT] Since the 2022 SAC, ACH has experienced notable demographic, utilization, and payer-mix shifts that reflect evolving community needs and ACH's success in expanding access. Source(s): UDS 2024.

[TEXT] Changes in the Service Area (Baseline UDS 2022 -> 2024)

[TEXT] · Growth and Demographics. Total patients increased by 15.2% (18,704 -> 21,538), driven primarily by children and working-age adults - evidence of successful family and youth engagement through school- and community-based outreach. The service area remains highly diverse, with racial/ethnic minority patients ~87% of those served. The Hispanic/Latino share grew from 31% to 38%, and those best served in a language other than English rose from 25.6% to 31.1%, underscoring the need for expanded bilingual staffing, interpreter services, and culturally tailored health education.

[TEXT] . Economic Vulnerability and Coverage. Nearly 99% of patients are ≤200% FPL and 86% are ≤100% FPL (+10 points since 2022), indicating heightened economic need and reliance on sliding fee and enabling services. The uninsured rate declined from 32% to 27%, while Medicaid/CHIP edged up (41.1% -> 41.4%) and other third-party coverage increased (12% -> ~20%), reflecting payer diversification and improved financial stability. The uninsured rate is also higher in Franklin County (13%) than the state (11%) and national (10%) averages, further limiting access to consistent primary and preventive care.

[TEXT] . Medicaid Expansion Impact. North Carolina's Medicaid expansion (effective Dec 1, 2023) is already reshaping the payer mix by shifting adults from uninsured to Medicaid. ACH's Outreach and Enrollment team continues assisting with applications, renewals, and benefits literacy - supporting prevention, chronic care continuity, and reduced uncompensated care.

[TEXT] · Service Utilization. Demand for comprehensive care continues to rise. Dental patients increased nearly 40% (3,054 -> 4,262) following capacity investments and targeted outreach. Behavioral health utilization also increased alongside growth in the integrated Behavioral Health model. Although the proportion of medical patients declined, overall encounters remained stable - a normalization effect as dental and BH volumes expanded and post-COVID coding stabilized.

[TEXT] · Special Populations. ACH served 870 individuals experiencing homelessness in 2024 - still substantial, though a smaller share due to total patient growth. The Health Care for the Homeless program provides mobile and on-site medical, dental, and behavioral health services, with care management for housing, employment, and recovery support. Engagement with Migratory and Seasonal Agricultural Workers (MSAW) populations rose (132 in 2024), and public-housing-associated patients increased by ~11% due to the opening of a service delivery location in 4/2024 adjacent to public housing (added ). Since 2023, school-based partnerships have expanded preventive and behavioral health access for children/adolescents.

[TEXT] · Community Health Environment. Regional population growth, private-sector workforce shortages, and persistent social risk factors (food insecurity, transportation, housing) have increased ACH's role as a safety-net provider. ACH has maintained and grown patient engagement via community partnerships, care coordination, and enabling services.

[TEXT] 2. Describe health care needs in the announced service area, including those that you are meeting or which are met by the current Health Center Program award recipient. If your service area includes HP, RPH, and/or MSAW funding, include the needs of each special medically underserved population. Address needs related to the following:

[TEXT] Residents across ACH's Wake and Franklin County service area experience diverse and persistent health needs that reflect both urban and rural disparities. The region includes multiple Medically Underserved Areas/Populations (MUA/Ps), HPSAs, and federally designated Opportunity Zones. Despite regional economic growth, significant gaps remain in access to affordable, comprehensive, and culturally competent care - particularly among low-income, uninsured, and minority populations. ACH's integrated model of care - grounded in prevention, chronic-disease management, and behavioral health integration - addresses these disparities by ensuring that high-quality services are accessible to all residents, regardless of ability to pay.

[TEXT] Health Care for the Homeless. Wake and Franklin Counties include a substantial and growing population experiencing homelessness. The Wake County Continuum of Care identified more than 1,200 individuals in the most recent Point-in-Time count, including those living unsheltered or in emergency and transitional housing. Rising housing costs and limited affordable units have contributed to this increase. Individuals experiencing homelessness face higher rates of chronic illness, behavioral health disorders, and substance-use conditions, often complicated by limited access to hygiene, medication storage, and follow- up care.

[TEXT] ACH's Health Care for the Homeless program delivers mobile and on-site medical, dental, and behavioral health services at shelters, and outreach sites. Care management staff assist with housing applications, employment resources, and linkage to recovery and behavioral health programs. Through strong partnerships with local shelters, food pantries, and housing agencies, ACH ensures care continuity for unsheltered and temporarily housed individuals and families.

[TEXT] These activities align with HRSA's expectations for outreach and service delivery to individuals experiencing homelessness under Section 330(h).

[TEXT] a. Comprehensive primary health care services, including in-scope nutrition, chronic disease management, preventive health education, cancer screening, and mental health services.

[TEXT] ACH ensures that all required services are available to patients either directly or through formal referral arrangements.

[HEADING] Clinical Data Summary (UDS 2022-2024)

[TEXT] ACH's clinical and population health data show consistent growth in patient volume, improved performance across several preventive and chronic disease measures, and continued emphasis on closing health disparities. Total patients increased from 18,704 in 2022 to 21,538 in 2024 (+15%), reflecting both expanded access and increased community demand.

[HEADING] Chronic Disease Trends.

[TEXT] · Hypertension: Hypertension remains the most prevalent chronic condition among ACH patients. The share of adult patients diagnosed with hypertension rose slightly from 43.1% (2022) to 46.2% (2024), reflecting enhanced screening and identification efforts. Blood pressure control (<140/90 mmHg) improved significantly - from 53.3% (2022) to 62.2% (2024) - a nine-percentage-point gain in two years. This reflects successful implementation of care coordination, adherence follow-up, and clinical decision-support tools within ACH's EpicCare Ambulatory (Epic) electronic health record (EHR).

[TEXT] . Diabetes: The proportion of adults with diabetes remained stable (28.2% -> 27.2%), while those with poorly controlled A1c (>9% or no test) rose from 25.8% -> 44.2%, prompting intensified outreach, point-of-care A1c testing, and adherence counseling.

[TEXT] . Asthma: Prevalence held steady (6.6% -> 7.1%). Clinical teams monitor medication compliance and environmental triggers through integrated primary-care and behavioral health coordination.

[TEXT] . HIV: Although a small portion of total patients (0.3% -> 0.5%), the number living with HIV increased from 54 to 82, consistent with regional epidemiologic trends. ACH continues to provide screening, linkage-to-care, and care management to maintain viral suppression. To address patient needs, ACH provides access to a part-time (0.8 FTE) nurse practitioner specializing in HIV care.

[TEXT] Cardiovascular Risk Reduction. Preventive cardiovascular care indicators remain strong and show incremental improvement:

[TEXT] · Statin therapy: Increased from 76.9% (2022) to 80.6% (2024), exceeding national health-center averages.

[TEXT] · Aspirin/antiplatelet use (IVD): Stable at 80.5% -> 79.0%, reflecting sustained adherence to secondary prevention standards.

[TEXT] Preventive Health Performance. Preventive screening performance has improved markedly since 2022, supported by Epic population registries, care coordinators, and focused outreach.

[TEXT] · Cervical cancer screening: 39.0% -> 49.6% (+10.6 points)

[TEXT] · Colorectal cancer screening: 13.8% -> 25.2% (+11.4 points)

[TEXT] · Breast cancer screening: 34.1% -> 38.9% (+4.8 points)

[TEXT] · HIV screening: 38.8% -> 64.2% (+25.4 points)

[TEXT] · Tobacco-use screening and cessation counseling: Consistently above 90% (2024)

[TEXT] Perinatal and Maternal Health. Prenatal care patients increased from 64 (2022) to 94 (2024) (+47%). Early entry into prenatal care (first trimester) improved from 50.0% -> 71.3%, surpassing pre-pandemic levels and ranking in the national second quartile. This progress reflects strengthened referral systems and proactive identification of pregnant patients by ACH's outreach and care coordination teams. ACH provides OB/GYN services including voluntary family planning, prenatal services, ultrasounds, and lactation services as a part of an overall comprehensive approach to addressing women's health needs (OB opened in 12/2024).

[TEXT] Behavioral Health and Integration. Behavioral health integration continues to expand. Depression screening increased to 74.9%, with improved follow-up documentation. Depression remission at 12 months reached 10.0% in 2024, showing gradual progress and highlighting the need for sustained behavioral health follow-up and telehealth therapy options.

[TEXT] ACH's performance trajectory demonstrates sustained improvement in chronic-disease control, preventive screening, and behavioral health integration. Clinical and operational teams employ Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles and Epic population-health dashboards to monitor outcomes, close care gaps, and guide continuous quality improvement.

[TEXT] Other indicators:

[TEXT] · Only 44% of Franklin County women and 49% of Wake County women receive annual mammography screenings, signaling persistent gaps in preventive care.

[TEXT] · Flu vaccination coverage, a proxy for preventive health engagement, stands at 53% in Franklin County and 59% in Wake County - modestly above state and national averages (51% and 48%, respectively).

[TEXT] · Preventable hospital stays remain elevated, with 3,149 per 100,000 Medicare enrollees in Franklin County and 2,399 per 100,000 in Wake County - both above or near the state (2,670) and national (2,666) averages.

[TEXT] coordination services that can address health-related social factors such as those related to food insecurity, housing insecurity, and financial strain).

[TEXT] Many ACH patients face socioeconomic barriers that affect access to and continuity of care. High rates of poverty, limited transportation, housing instability, and food insecurity are common across the service area. ACH provides a comprehensive array of enabling and patient-support services to mitigate these barriers.

[TEXT] Each patient completes an annual social drivers of health assessment through the EHR. Identified needs - such as food insecurity, financial strain, or transportation challenges - trigger immediate connections to enabling-service staff or community partners. Patients receive assistance with insurance enrollment, transportation coordination, care management, and linkage to social-service programs.

[TEXT] Every patient requiring enhanced support is assigned a care coordinator or care manager who helps navigate medical, behavioral, and community resources. Care managers focus on clinical goals, while coordinators guide patients and families to need support, including vouchers for healthy food, housing resources, and job training opportunities. ACH's care management continuum extends into home and community settings, ensuring post-hospital follow-up and continuity for high-risk or chronically ill patients.

[TEXT] Since January through October 2025, ACH staff delivered more than 10,800 enabling and supportive service encounters to ACH patients - strengthening access, improving care coordination, and addressing social drivers of health.

[TEXT] These services - beyond required case management - have provided patients with critical connections to non-medical, social, and educational resources, including transportation, food access, Medicaid eligibility, and health education. Notably, the largest areas of impact include:

[TEXT] · Coordinating care and transitions across settings (4,014 encounters), ensuring continuity after hospital or specialty visits.

[TEXT] · Health and wellness outreach (2,043 calls) to support preventive care and patient engagement.

[TEXT] · Case management and care gap outreach (1,578 combined encounters) to address chronic disease management, missed visits, and preventive screenings.

[TEXT] · Transportation assistance (391 encounters) to remove access barriers for medically underserved patients.

[TEXT] Additional services include language interpretation, clinical pharmacist interventions, and group education sessions, reflecting ACH's comprehensive, patient-centered approach.

[TEXT] These results underscore ACH's ability to rapidly deploy enabling services infrastructure, integrate outreach and care coordination functions, and meet HRSA expectations for comprehensive, accessible, and equitable care across the expanded service area.

[TEXT] Project Narrative Fiscal Year 2026 Service Area Competition HRSA-26-004 increases demand for chronic-disease management, medication reconciliation, and coordination with home- and community-based service providers.

[TEXT] Language access remains a persistent need, especially among Spanish-speaking and limited-English- proficiency (LEP) residents. To meet HCP requirements, ACH mitigates this barrier by employing bilingual staff, offering interpreter services, and translating patient-education materials to ensure culturally and linguistically appropriate care.

[TEXT] ACH's integrated, patient-centered model, combining medical, dental, behavioral health, and enabling services, directly addresses these needs. The health center continuously refines its services based on findings from community needs assessments, patient feedback, and quality-improvement data. These coordinated efforts allow ACH to adapt quickly to emerging trends and ensure equitable access to comprehensive, high-quality primary care for all residents in its service area.

[TEXT] 3. Describe any recent or potential changes in the local health care landscape and how those changes may affect the needs of the target population.

[TEXT] The ACH service area is amid massive shifts that impact patient access, our workforce, and sustainability.

[TEXT] North Carolina Medicaid Expansion. The 2023 decision to expand Medicaid in NC began a flurry of activity to increase health care access to eligible patients has served as the catalyst for current and potential changes in Wake and Franklin Counties. The biggest change is patient demand for accessible and affordable care, which creates competition and the need for Advance to expand and enhance required services. In the coming months, as Medicaid guidelines change, we anticipate a spike in the number of uninsured and underinsured patients needing access to our services and programs. Our growing patient base will need to leverage the essential structure of our health center: SFDS (Sliding Fee Discount Schedule), same day access, and enabling services to ensure their wellbeing.

[TEXT] Workforce. Not only do we have a responsibility to hire and train the next generation of health care professionals, but we also have a responsibility to ensure workforce is deployed to areas of greatest need. In both counties that complete our service area there are multiple community reports of office and hospital closures that only increase the demand for qualified providers. In many cases we are creating strategies to support these practices via managed services to ensure quality and access are maintained in our community. The sustainability of primary care, especially in the rural designated parts of our service area, is essential. Advance is the measured and documented safety net for Wake and Franklin counties.

[TEXT] Reimbursement. As of Oct 1, 2025, Medicaid reimbursement across North Carolina was reduced by 3%. This policy will not change how we provide care, however; it will challenge our overall mission - less resources for patients that need access. Again, as the safety net for Wake and Franklin counites, thousands of years working families are depending on the ACH system to manage their care, support their health goals, and assist them in navigating an ever-changing health care landscape.

This initiative supports HRSA's priorities to reduce health disparities, prevent avoidable hospitalizations, and improve population health outcomes across medically underserved areas in both rural and urban communities throughout the United States.

[TEXT] The ACH coordinated service delivery network ensures that all individuals, regardless of income or insurance status, have equitable access to the full scope of in-house and referral services throughout the service area.

[TEXT] 1. Describe how the proposed service delivery sites on Form 5B: Service Sites will support access to your services (consistent with Form 5A: Services Provided) and minimize barriers within the proposed service area, including:

[TEXT] a. Where your service delivery sites are located, compared to where the target population lives and works.

[TEXT] ACH has strategically located its service delivery sites and mobile unit (Form 5B) to maximize accessibility for the target population and ensure full alignment with the scope of services provided (Form 5A). Each site is positioned in neighborhoods with the highest concentrations of medically underserved residents - areas characterized by high poverty rates, chronic disease burden, and limited access to private health care providers. Strategic locations include:

[TEXT] . Proximity to Patients' Homes and Workplaces: ACH sites are located in or near communities where most patients live and work, reducing transportation barriers and improving convenience for families and working adults.

[TEXT] · Accessible to Employment Centers and Schools: Several sites are situated near major employment corridors, schools, and public housing complexes, enabling patients to seek care without missing work or school.

[TEXT] . Urban and Rural Reach: ACH maintains a balanced network of urban and rural locations to serve both densely populated areas and remote communities. Rural sites reduce travel time for isolated residents, while urban clinics reach economically disadvantaged populations facing access challenges within the city. ACH has a mobile clinic that brings primary care, screenings, chronic care management, and other services directly to neighborhoods and schools, mitigating geographic and transportation barriers.

[TEXT] . Recent Expansion Reflects Responsiveness: In 2024-2025, ACH added six new or expanded sites in direct response to community-identified needs. This growth demonstrates ACH's ability to adapt quickly to demand, expand capacity for primary, dental, and behavioral health services, and sustain access for vulnerable residents across the service area.

[TEXT] Minimizing Barriers to Care. ACH minimizes barriers by pairing strategic site placement with patient- focused access supports. Each location maintains hours and services designed to meet the community's needs. Same-day and walk-in appointments are available at all sites, and patients can schedule visits via the patient portal, by phone or in person to accommodate varying levels of digital access.

[TEXT] . Public Transportation Access: Most sites are located along major bus routes or community transit lines.

[TEXT] · Extended Hours: Select locations offer evening and weekend hours to accommodate working families.

[TEXT] · Enabling Services: Transportation coordination, interpretation, and benefits-enrollment assistance ensure that geography, language, or income do not prevent patients from accessing care.

[TEXT] In addition, ACH operates a multi-disciplinary mobile unit that delivers medical, dental, and behavioral health services directly to underserved populations across its service area. The mobile unit provides critical flexibility, enabling ACH to remain nimble and responsive to emerging community needs. By bringing care to where residents naturally congregate - such as homeless shelters, soup kitchens, community centers, public housing, churches, and schools - ACH eliminates traditional barriers to access and strengthens its connection with the community.

[TEXT] This mobile outreach model has become a core component of ACH's growth strategy, expanding access to comprehensive, integrated care while fostering trust, engagement, and early intervention among hard-to- reach populations.

[TEXT] More than 90% of ACH patients reside within 10 miles of a service site (less with the ACH mobile capabilities), confirming that the network effectively reaches the populations most affected by poverty, chronic disease, and limited provider availability. Through intentional expansion and accessibility supports, ACH ensures that comprehensive, patient-centered services remain available, accessible, and equitable for all residents throughout its service area.

[HEADING] b. How you will address geographic barriers, location of sites, and hours of operation.

[TEXT] ACH is committed to ensuring that every resident of Wake and Franklin Counties has access to comprehensive, high-quality, and affordable care - regardless of geographic, transportation, or scheduling barriers. ACH continuously evaluates the service area in partnership with the North Carolina Community Health Center Association (NCCHCA), neighboring health centers, and community safety-net organizations to identify areas where primary care shortages and access gaps persist.

[TEXT] Addressing Geographic Barriers. ACH serves both densely populated urban neighborhoods and rural, medically underserved communities. Patients in Franklin County often face rural access challenges such as long travel distances, limited provider availability, and inadequate public transportation options. In contrast, patients in urban Wake County may encounter heavy traffic congestion, lack of reliable transit in certain neighborhoods, and difficulty obtaining care near their homes or workplaces. To address these issues, ACH collaborates with county agencies and local partners to provide transportation assistance, including ride-share or community transit vouchers. Care Coordinators assist patients in scheduling appointments and connecting to community-based transit programs, ensuring that transportation is never a barrier to receiving care.

[TEXT] Location of Sites. ACH has strategically located its clinical sites in medically underserved and high-need areas to maximize accessibility for the populations most in need. Sites are geographically distributed across both Wake and Franklin Counties to provide a balance of rural and urban access. The placement of sites aligns with population density, poverty concentrations, and health-disparity indicators identified through ongoing needs assessments. Expansion of service locations since the last SAC application, demonstrates ACH's intentional commitment to reducing travel times and aligning services with where patients live, work, and attend school. As shared above, ACH has the flexibility to respond to community needs with mobile medical, dental, and behavioral health.

[TEXT] Hours of Operation. To further enhance accessibility, ACH offers extended hours at key locations, including early morning, evening, and weekend appointments. Same-day appointments and dedicated urgent-care slots support patients with acute needs, while telehealth visits provide a convenient option for patients unable to travel to a clinic. For urgent concerns after regular business hours, ACH provides 24/7 access through its after-hours and on-call offerings, which connect patients to an on-call licensed provider via the professional answering service, ensuring continuity of care and timely clinical advice.

[TEXT] Through strategic site placement, extended hours, HIPAA-compliant telehealth with Epic integration, and robust enabling services, ACH effectively minimizes the impact of geographic and logistical barriers. These coordinated efforts ensure that all members of the target population - whether rural, urban, working, uninsured, or transportation-limited - can access timely, patient-centered care that supports equitable health outcomes across the region.

[TEXT] Collectively, these integrated strategies ensure that all patients within the service area can readily access ACH primary, dental, and behavioral health services without geographic or financial barriers.

[TEXT] Coverage for Emergencies During and After Hours - Column (1); Column (2) ACH maintains written operating procedures to ensure an effective response to patient medical emergencies occurring after normal business hours. To provide continuous access to care, ACH utilizes an established system offering coverage 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. After-hours calls are routed to CareXM, a professional answering service, which records the patient's name and reason for the call and notifies the on-call provider as appropriate. The on-call provider triages calls, provides clinical guidance, and refers patients to the appropriate level of care, including the nearest emergency department when necessary. All encounters are documented in the EHR.

[TEXT] All ACH sites utilize an EHR system that allows on-call providers to securely access patient medical records and health histories from the clinic or remotely, enhancing care coordination and continuity. In addition, all ACH practitioners have access to external health information through Health Information Exchange (HIE) networks, including Care Everywhere and the Epic Admission, Discharge, and Transfer (ADT) interface, to ensure seamless integration of health services across care settings.

[TEXT] HIE network participants include WakeMed and UNC REX Hospital, which assists in coordination of care and follow-up. If an ACH patient is admitted other than through a referral, hospitalists notify ACH through the EHR. Nurse Care Managers employed by ACH are embedded on-site at partner hospitals and meet with ACH patients upon admission or discharge to coordinate post-hospital care. This includes scheduling follow-up visits and ensuring a smooth transition back to primary care.

[TEXT] Most ACH patients residing in Franklin County receive hospital services at WakeMed hospitals; however, some also utilize Duke Raleigh Hospital and UNC REX Hospital for inpatient or specialty care as needed.

[TEXT] . Column (2): CareXM - formerly Telemed. To ensure continuity of care, ACH has developed an on-call system and mechanisms for after-hours instruction through an After-Hours Answering Service. ACH patients utilize the service to contact their provider for "after hours" emergent care. ACH pays for this service monthly with no cost to patients. ACH reviews after-hours logs daily and documents all clinical dispositions and follow-up in the EHR.

[TEXT] · Goal for 2026: Increase to six trained and authorized Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD) prescribers within ACH to ensure sustainability and expanded patient access.

[TEXT] ACH utilizes the standardized AUDIT-C and DAST tools to screen patients for substance use disorders. The results from the screening are documented in the EHR system, and patients who screen for risk are educated regarding their results by a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) who is equipped to provide an immediate intervention per the Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) model. The goal of this brief intervention is to move the client to a point of readiness to initiate appropriate treatment. Patients are then referred as needed to an onsite behavioral health provider. After the behavioral health visit, the behavioral health and primary care providers meet to review the plan of care. If an outside referral is needed, care management staff assist with making a referral, work to obtain results with the referral provider after the visit, and schedule any follow-up visits needed with ACH.

[TEXT] Primary care and behavioral health providers share the same EHR, share scheduling, and meet face-to- face to discuss complex needs of patients - for instance, when a patient has a debilitating medical condition such as cirrhosis, or when the behavioral health provider has sent the patient for more complex treatment such as detox or inpatient psychiatry. Providers are also able to alert each other and share notes via EHR.

When a referral is needed, whether between ACH sites or to an external specialty care provider - the LCSW or Behavioral Health Coordinator arranges the appointment, notifies the patient of the date and time, and transmits relevant chart information to the referral provider via secure fax. The LCSW then confirms receipt of the information and documents the referral in the EHR.

[TEXT] All referrals are entered and tracked through the EHR system. If a patient misses an appointment with a referral provider, staff contact the patient to determine the reason and assist in rescheduling. Patients receive reminders by phone, text message, and mail regarding appointment dates, times, and locations. When barriers to care arise, staff assist patients in addressing those barriers - such as arranging transportation - to ensure timely access to needed services.

[TEXT] · Depression Screening and Follow-Up (UDS Measure): All patients 12 and older are screened for depression during primary care visits, with same-day warm handoffs ensuring timely intervention and follow-up.

[TEXT] · Substance Use Disorder Treatment Engagement: Patients with identified alcohol or drug use concerns are connected with ACH's licensed substance use disorder therapist for counseling, with referrals tracked and monitored in the EHR.

[TEXT] · Chronic Disease Management Support: Behavioral health services are integrated into care plans for patients with diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, improving adherence and outcomes across medical and behavioral health domains.

[TEXT] Through this integrated, team-based model, ACH not only expands access to mental health care but also demonstrates measurable improvements in UDS performance, advancing whole-person health and reducing disparities in both Wake and Franklin Counties.

[TEXT] Patient Support Services. Patient support services such as services to support patients' access to healthy foods and other resources that can address barriers to health and wellbeing are available at all ACH sites. ACH has transformed enabling services into a full spectrum continuum of support spanning across the patient's home, community, primary care visit, and encompasses any inpatient or post-discharge setting. Care management and coordination leverages health assessment surveys, completed by patients annually, to determine what solutions need to be a part of the care plan. Each patient is assigned a coordinator that helps patients navigate services vital to their overall wellness. The care managers are responsible for the Advance Community Health, Inc.

[TEXT] clinical goals of the patient and the care coordinators guide patients and families to necessary resources, including transportation, vouchers for health food options, housing, and job readiness/training.

[TEXT] ACH recognizes that addressing social drivers of health is critical to improving outcomes and reducing disparities. ACH considers enabling services a foundation for a full-spectrum continuum of support that spans across the patient's home, community, primary care visit, and extends into inpatient and post- discharge settings.

[TEXT] Through ACH's care management and coordination program, patients complete annual health assessment surveys to identify barriers to health and wellbeing. These assessments inform each patient's individualized care plan and ensure that non-clinical needs are addressed alongside medical goals.

[TEXT] Each patient is supported by a care coordinator, who helps patients and families navigate vital services such as:

[TEXT] . Access to healthy foods: Distribution of fresh produce, nutrition vouchers, and referrals to community food resources.

[TEXT] . Transportation support: Public transit connections, ride-share vouchers, and coordination with community transportation programs.

[TEXT] · Housing stability: Referrals to local housing agencies and assistance programs to reduce homelessness and unsafe living conditions.

[TEXT] · Employment readiness: Job readiness, training, and workforce development referrals to strengthen family stability and economic security.

[TEXT] Care managers are accountable for the clinical goals of each patient (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, preventive screenings), while care coordinators address the social, behavioral, and logistical supports necessary to achieve those goals.

[TEXT] This integrated model ensures patients receive whole-person care that connects clinical treatment with community-based resources, reducing barriers and producing measurable improvements in UDS quality measures such as diabetes control, hypertension control, and depression follow-up.

[TEXT] These services are essential to both improving health outcomes in the populations served by health centers and reducing the costs of chronic disease. Health Center Program award recipients provide all services on a sliding fee scale and regardless of a patient's ability to pay.

[TEXT] d. How you will support continuity, clinical effectiveness, and patient-centered care coordination.

[TEXT] ACH is committed to ensuring that every patient receives consistent, high-quality, and coordinated care across the full continuum of services. ACH supports continuity of care by assigning patients to a primary care provider and care team that remains consistent over time, fostering trusted relationships and familiarity with each patient's medical history, health goals, and social circumstances. This continuity reduces fragmentation, enhances patient trust, and improves adherence to care plans.

[TEXT] ACH is committed to delivering patient-centered care that recognizes each individual's unique needs, preferences, and circumstances. Care is not one-size-fits-all but instead designed in partnership with patients to empower them to take an active role in achieving their health goals.

[TEXT] . Tailored to the Individual: Providers and care teams use a whole-person approach that considers medical conditions, behavioral health needs, cultural background, language, and social drivers of health. Patients are engaged through shared decision-making, ensuring that treatment options align with their values, preferences, and life situations.

[TEXT] . Empowerment and Informed Decisions: ACH educates patients about their conditions, treatment options, and self-care strategies in clear, culturally appropriate language. Health educators, care managers, and care coordinators provide resources and coaching so that patients can make informed choices and confidently participate in their care.

[TEXT] · Comprehensive Care Plans: For patients with complex or chronic conditions, ACH's interdisciplinary care teams develop individualized care plans that integrate medical, behavioral, and enabling services. Each plan includes measurable clinical goals, patient-identified priorities, and timelines for follow-up. Patients and families actively participate in creating and revising their plans, reinforcing shared accountability, engagement, and continuity of care.

[TEXT] . Ongoing Support and Monitoring: ACH integrates care coordination, health coaching, and behavioral health consultation into primary care visits, ensuring that patients have continuous support.

[TEXT] g. How the additional services you provide will address any other unique needs that impact health status.

[TEXT] ACH recognizes that the populations it serves face unique health and social challenges that extend beyond the scope of required primary care services. In response, ACH provides a range of additional services, as defined by HRSA, designed to address these needs and improve overall health outcomes. These include Additional Dental Services, Mental Health Services, Environmental Health Services, Nutrition, and Additional Enabling/Supportive Services that connect patients with essential community resources.

[TEXT] By delivering these services in direct response to community-identified needs, ACH ensures patients have access to holistic supports that address the root causes of poor health outcomes. This patient-centered approach promotes prevention, strengthens overall health status, reduces health disparities, and fosters long-term community wellness across Wake and Franklin Counties.

[TEXT] 3. Describe how you will expand access to additional services such as nutrition counseling and wellness promotion in response to your needs assessment.

[TEXT] ACH is committed to expanding services in direct response to findings from its most recent CHNA, which identified nutritional support, chronic disease prevention, and wellness promotion as high-priority needs across all patient populations. UDS data confirm elevated rates of obesity, hypertension, and diabetes - combined with food insecurity and limited preventive health education - underscoring the urgent need to expand these services across Wake and Franklin Counties.

[TEXT] ACH's expansion strategy focuses on key priorities:

[TEXT] Strengthen Nutrition Counseling and Chronic Disease Education. ACH continues to expand access to nutrition services by integrating registered dietitians into primary care teams at all sites. These professionals provide one-on-one nutrition counseling for patients with diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and other chronic conditions, while also offering group classes on meal planning, culturally appropriate dietary practices, and food label education.

[TEXT] Nutrition counseling is documented and tracked through the Epic EHR to monitor goals and outcomes and ensure coordinated follow-up. ACH also partners with community food banks and local organizations to strengthen food-security resources and reinforce healthy-eating habits.

[TEXT] ACH offers Dia-Beat It, an eight-week diabetes prevention and management program. The program focuses on improving nutrition, increasing physical activity, and promoting overall wellness for adults at risk for or living with diabetes.

[TEXT] Increase Wellness Promotion and Community Education. ACH is expanding its wellness initiatives that empower patients to take a proactive role in their health. This includes group health-education classes, chronic disease self-management workshops, fitness and physical-activity promotion, and community health fairs.

[TEXT] Address Food Insecurity Through Fresh-Food Access and Partnerships. To combat food insecurity, ACH will continue to serve as a hub for fresh-food distribution, expanding partnerships with regional food banks and local farms to provide fruits and vegetables throughout the year.

[TEXT] In 2025, ACH will implement "produce prescriptions" that integrate food access directly into care plans for patients with nutrition-sensitive chronic conditions. These efforts reduce barriers to healthy eating and reinforce preventive strategies emphasized during clinical encounters.

[TEXT] ACH collaborates with local schools, faith-based organizations, and community centers through the Make America Healthy Again initiative to extend wellness activities and preventive education beyond the clinic walls. These partnerships promote preventive health behaviors and connect residents to ACH's integrated care model through on-site health screenings, nutrition demonstrations, fitness classes, and education sessions on topics such as tobacco cessation and mental wellness. By reaching underserved and rural populations where they live, work, and gather, ACH strengthens its role as a trusted health partner and advances whole-person, community-based care across the service area.

[TEXT] All initiatives are aligned with ACH's QIRM plan and linked to measurable outcomes, including BMI screening and follow-up, diabetes (HbA1c) control, and hypertension control. Progress is monitored through QI dashboards, staff training, and quarterly committee and Board review to ensure accountability and continuous improvement.

[TEXT] Through these coordinated strategies, ACH expands both clinical nutrition counseling and community wellness programs to meet the needs identified through its CHNA - promoting equitable access, supporting whole-person health, and advancing HRSA's goals for prevention, education, and improved outcomes among underserved populations.

[TEXT] a. How you assess all patients for sliding fee discount eligibility based only on income and family size. See income definition in Chapter 9: Sliding Fee Discount Program of the Compliance Manual.

[TEXT] ACH provides services according to a Board-approved SFDP based solely on income and family size, consistent with Chapter 9 of HRSA's Compliance Manual. The SFDS applies to patients with incomes up to 200% of the FPG.

[TEXT] ACH utilizes written policies and procedures to implement the SFDS. These policies and procedures define income and family size, specify documentation or verification requirements for determining and recording family size and income, detail the specific structure for the SFDS itself, establish the frequency for re- evaluation of patient eligibility, and address provisions for waiving fees and nominal charges for specific patient circumstances.

[TEXT] Family size and income are verified using official documentation to determine wages and salary, excluding assets and other similar items, consistent with HRSA definitions. These figures are compared to the annually published FPG. ACH follows HRSA's definition of "family," which is a group of two or more persons related by birth, marriage, or adoption who live together; all such related persons are considered members of one family.

[TEXT] Eligibility determinations are conducted respectfully, confidentially, and in a culturally appropriate manner to avoid barriers to care. Acceptable income documentation includes recent pay stubs, tax returns, or other verifiable proof of earnings; assets are not considered.

[TEXT] When patients inquire about or are invited to apply for the Sliding Fee Discount Program, front-office staff or Patient Financial Navigators provide assistance with completing the application. Applications are reviewed and updated annually, or sooner if there is a change in household income or size. For patients who are unemployed, report zero income, or are homeless or transitioning from homelessness, eligibility is re-evaluated every six months to ensure continued accuracy.

[TEXT] Patients without income documentation may self-declare income for one visit per year; documentation must be provided at the next visit or the patient is classified as self-pay.

[TEXT] For homeless individuals, ACH follows Section 330 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. § 254b) and Bureau of Primary Health Care definitions of homelessness. Per guidance, an individual may be considered homeless if they are "doubled up" with others, or if they are a previously homeless person being discharged from a hospital, prison, or similar institution without stable housing to return to. All patients who identify as homeless, regardless of insurance status, must provide documentation of their homeless status consistent with this definition. Acceptable documentation includes a certification letter from a shelter or social service agency or correlating verification forms such as household instability or "doubled-up" documentation. This documentation is attached to the patient's SFDP application to ensure eligibility determination aligns with HRSA requirements.

[TEXT] Reference Attachment 10: Sliding Fee Discount Schedule(s).

[TEXT] b. How you adjust patient charges based on the ability to pay (consistent with Attachment 10: Sliding Fee Discount Schedule).

[TEXT] ACH adjusts patient charges based on ability to pay through its Board-approved SFDP. Discounts are applied using a SFDS aligned with the most recent FPG and determined by verified household income and family size.

[TEXT] The SFDP applies to all individuals and families with annual incomes between 100% and 200% of the FPG. Discounts (flat or percentage-based) are applied consistently across all service types, including medical, behavioral health, dental, nursing, nutrition, pharmacy, urgent care, integrated care, and OB/GYN.

[TEXT] Patients with annual incomes at or below 100% of the FPG are charged only a nominal fee, while those between 101% and 200% of the FPG receive graduated discounts. The SFDS includes four pay classes above 100% FPG - 101-125%, 126-150%, 151-175%, and 176-200%. No sliding fee discount is approved for individuals or families with incomes exceeding 200% of the FPG.

[TEXT] All services are billed at their full established charge, and discounts are applied according to each patient's verified eligibility level. Uninsured patients and those who are underinsured (with self-pay balances such as co-payments or deductibles) are encouraged to apply for the SFDP.

[TEXT] Eligibility is determined and documented annually, based on verification of income and household size, and reassessed whenever a change in financial circumstances occurs. ACH ensures that no patient is denied care due to inability to pay, thereby maintaining equitable access to all health center services.

[TEXT] Each year, the Board of Trustees, comprised of a patient-majority membership, reviews and approves the SFDS to incorporate the most recent FPG. As part of this review, the Board evaluates the structure and effectiveness of the discount schedule to ensure it continues to reduce financial barriers to care. This includes reviewing UDS data, practice management system financial reports, and patient satisfaction survey results to assess whether patients across all discount pay classes are accessing care.

[TEXT] d. How you evaluate your sliding fee discount program to ensure that it reduces financial barriers to care.

[TEXT] ACH regularly evaluates its SFDP to ensure it effectively reduces financial barriers and promotes equitable access to care.

[TEXT] The nominal and discount fee schedules are reviewed annually by the Board of Trustees to ensure continued affordability and alignment with the most current FPG. As part of this review, ACH analyzes utilization data, patient satisfaction survey results, and feedback from front-line staff and Patient Financial Navigators to assess whether fees remain reasonable and non-restrictive for low-income patients.

[TEXT] To further prevent financial hardship, ACH works directly with patients to establish payment plans when needed. In cases where nominal fees pose a financial burden, waivers or alternative arrangements may be granted. Waiver authority is delegated to the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Medical Officer, and Director of Patient Financial Services, with requests initiated by practice managers or providers.

[TEXT] ACH also monitors self-pay and uninsured visit trends, missed appointment rates, and collections data as part of its QI monitoring process. These findings are presented to the Board of Trustees during the annual SFDS review for consideration of any adjustments to fee structures or pay classes.

These staff members help patients, especially those with complex medical or social needs, navigate the health care system, understand their care plans, and maintain continuity of care. They provide education on preventive services, assist with insurance enrollment, and address social drivers of health such as transportation, housing, and food insecurity.

[TEXT] ACH's care model is designed to meet the unique needs of low-income, uninsured, underinsured, homeless, and rural residents of Wake and Franklin Counties. Services are delivered by bilingual, culturally competent staff and supported by targeted community outreach events to increase access and reduce health disparities. ACH routinely reviews UDS data, patient satisfaction surveys, and community needs assessments to identify gaps in care and guide quality improvement initiatives that enhance patient experience and health outcomes across all populations served.

[TEXT] 7. Describe your process to ensure continuity of care for patients. Include:

[TEXT] a. Communication tools, referral processes, and electronic exchange of patient health records.

[TEXT] b. Hospital admitting privileges.

[TEXT] c. Receipt, follow-up, and recording of medical information from referral sources.

[TEXT] d. Follow-up for patients who are hospitalized or visit a hospital's emergency department.

[TEXT] ACH ensures continuity of care through well-defined communication systems, referral processes, electronic data exchange, and coordinated follow-up for patients receiving services both within and outside the health center network. ACH utilizes the Epic EHR system, which includes the Care Everywhere interoperability feature to securely exchange patient health information with external partners - such as hospitals, specialists, and other health care providers. Referral orders and care coordination activities are documented in the EHR to ensure providers have timely access to patient records and care plans. Referral staff coordinate and track external referrals to ensure receipt of consultation notes and test results, and the Care Management Department reviews all referrals to ensure follow-up is completed in accordance with care plans. Data sharing occurs securely through the NC Health Information Exchange (NCHIE) and integrated hospital portals. Communication tools such as direct messaging, patient portal communication, and phone follow-ups support timely coordination with patients and external partners.

[TEXT] Project Narrative Fiscal Year 2026 Service Area Competition HRSA-26-004

[TEXT] ACH providers collaborate closely with hospital partners to ensure continuity of care but do not maintain direct admitting privileges. Instead, ACH maintains formal referral and communication protocols with area hospitals to facilitate inpatient coordination, data sharing, and post-discharge transitions. Hospitalists and emergency department physicians provide inpatient care, while ACH providers resume primary care management upon discharge. Continuity of care following hospitalization or emergency department use is a key quality focus. Providers document all hospital and emergency referrals in Epic, including the receiving facility, reason for transfer, and diagnosis. The Care Management team accesses hospital discharge data daily, contacts patients, reviews discharge instructions, reconciles medications, and schedules follow-up visits within seven days post-discharge.

[TEXT] HIE network participants include WakeMed and UNC REX Hospital, which assists in coordination of care and follow-up. If an ACH patient is admitted other than through a referral, hospitalists notify ACH through the EHR. Nurse Care Managers employed by ACH are embedded on-site at partner hospitals and meet with ACH patients upon admission or discharge to coordinate post-hospital care. This includes scheduling follow-up visits and ensuring a smooth transition back to primary care.

[TEXT] For after-hours emergencies, ACH's 24-hour on-call system ensures patients have immediate access to a licensed provider for triage and referral to appropriate care. During clinic hours, medical emergencies are managed by the Medical Emergencies and Emergency Transport Policy until EMS arrives.

[TEXT] In accordance with ACH's Hospitalization Tracking Policy, all hospitalizations and emergency department visits (excluding behavioral health) are tracked through the EHR. When notified of a hospitalization or emergency department visit, clinical staff log into the EpicCare Everywhere admission and discharge portal to import discharge summaries into the EHR, while the Care Management Department contacts the patient to schedule a follow-up appointment within seven days. Care Managers review discharge records, conduct medication reconciliation, update care plans, and ensure appropriate Care Management enrollment. ACH staff make three outreach attempts within a seven-day period using at least two methods, including telephone, mail, chart messaging, email, or fax. If the patient cannot be reached, a letter is sent, and ACH uses best efforts and available resources to locate and engage the patient, including pharmacy and hospital outreach, family contact, and searches through NCHIE.

[TEXT] To ensure HRSA compliance, ACH tracks hospitalization follow-up appointments monthly. Results of continuity-of-care metrics (hospital follow-up within seven days, closed referral rates, and 30-day readmission rates) are reported quarterly to the QI/QA Committee and incorporated into ACH's UDS performance reviews. The Data Analyst and site Practice Managers perform regular audits submitted to the Risk Manager and/or Compliance Officer to monitor adherence and outcomes. All follow-up activities, patient contacts, and external reports are documented in the EHR to ensure seamless coordination across care settings. Monitoring and data reporting are conducted under ACH's Program Monitoring and Data Systems Policy to ensure accurate, timely analysis of service utilization and performance trends, reinforcing ACH's commitment to continuous quality improvement and comprehensive, coordinated patient care.

[HEADING] COLLABORATION

[TEXT] 1. Describe how you collaborate with community partners to increase awareness of and address the community's health and health-related needs.

[TEXT] ACH has a long history of collaborating with diverse community partners to both increase awareness of available services and address the broad health and health-related needs of its service area. ACH recognizes that improving community health outcomes requires strong, sustained partnerships that extend beyond the health center walls.

[TEXT] . Awareness and Outreach: ACH works with schools, faith-based organizations, social service agencies, and local employers to provide health education, screenings, and information about available services. Partnerships with local media outlets and community-based coalitions amplify outreach campaigns on preventive care, vaccination, and chronic disease management. ACH also engages trusted community leaders to increase awareness among populations that may face cultural, linguistic, or economic barriers to care.

[TEXT] · Addressing Social Drivers of Health: Through collaboration with housing agencies, food banks, transportation providers, and workforce development organizations, ACH connects patients to critical enabling services. These partnerships ensure patients have access to housing stability, healthy foods, reliable transportation, and job resources - factors that directly influence health outcomes.

[TEXT] . Public Health and Health System Partnerships: ACH coordinates closely with local health departments, hospitals, and behavioral health providers to align care, respond to public health priorities, and improve transitions of care. Joint initiatives include immunization drives, chronic disease prevention programs, and emergency preparedness responses, ensuring that vulnerable populations receive timely and coordinated support.

[TEXT] · Community Engagement and Needs Assessment: ACH involves community partners in its formal needs assessment process to identify emerging health challenges, set priorities, and co-develop solutions. These relationships ensure that services remain responsive to evolving community needs and that interventions are tailored to populations most at risk.

[TEXT] Through these partnerships, ACH enhances community trust, expands access to services, and builds a stronger safety net to address both health and health-related needs. This collaborative approach strengthens ACH's role as a pillar of community health for more than 50 years.

[TEXT] 2. Describe your efforts to collaborate and coordinate services with other providers and community organizations. In Attachment 9: Collaboration Documentation, provide Letters of Support from providers you work with. You should also note providers on Attachment 1: Service Area Map and Table. Include documentation from:

[TEXT] a. Other HRSA-supported health centers, including look-alikes. If you cannot obtain a requested letter of support from other health centers, provide evidence of your request for the letter of support.

[TEXT] b. Providers of specialty services and other services not available through your organization.

[TEXT] c. Local hospitals, to reduce non-urgent use of hospital emergency departments.

[TEXT] d. Others that serve similar populations (such as health departments, schools, community organizations, homeless shelters, and Indian Health Service health facilities).

[TEXT] ACH met compliance standards during the 2024 Operational Site Visit. Per the 2024 Operational Site Visit Review Chapter 14: Collaborative Relationships | Compliance Status - Met. ACH adheres to Section 330(k)(3)(B) of the PHS Act; and 42 CFR 51c.303(n), 42 CFR 56.303(n), and 42 CFR 51c.305(h)

[TEXT] To extend care and maximize resources, ACH integrates and coordinates activities with other providers and programs in the service area. Collaborations go beyond day-to-day coordination to include joint planning, data sharing, and co-design of initiatives that improve community outcomes - supporting continuity of care, access to services not available on-site, and reduced non-urgent use of hospital emergency departments.

[TEXT] Existing Health Center Programs and Look-Alikes.

[TEXT] One FQHC Look-Alike operates in the service area: NeighborHealth Center, based in Raleigh, NC. NeighborHealth provides comprehensive primary and preventive care services, including family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, women's health, behavioral health, and chronic disease management. The organization also offers immunizations, laboratory services, care coordination, and limited dental and pharmacy assistance through partnerships. Services are available to patients regardless of ability to pay, with a sliding fee discount program based on income and family size.

[TEXT] In 2024, NeighborHealth served 7,885 total patients. The organization did not provide services to individuals experiencing homelessness or to migratory or seasonal agricultural workers and their family members. Source(s): UDS 2024.

[TEXT] ACH maintains a Memorandum of Agreement with NeighborHealth through which ACH provides dental services to NeighborHealth Center patients. This collaboration enhances continuity of care among community providers and expands access to comprehensive oral health services for the local population.

[TEXT] Several FQHCs are dominant in parts of the broader region but have no physical sites within the defined service area, including Carolina Family Health Centers, Lincoln Community Health Center, and CommWell Health (formerly Tri-County Community Health Council). These organizations operate in adjacent counties and extend some services to patients who may reside within the proposed service area. ACH and CommWell Health collaborate through the NCCHCA, supporting continuity of care, shared learning, and alignment of best practices across community providers.

[TEXT] The North Carolina Office of Rural Health (NCORH) - Farmworker Health Program administrative center is also based in Raleigh; however, this site does not provide direct services to the target population. Instead, NCORH contracts with health entities across the state that are located in areas with a high concentration of migratory and seasonal agricultural workers to deliver care to that population. ACH provides primary care services for farmworkers by referral from NCORH as needed, ensuring access to care for this vulnerable group within the service area.

[TEXT] Other FQHCs with sites adjacent to the service area but without dominant penetration include Piedmont Health Services, Goshen Medical Center, First Choice Community Health Centers, and Rural Health Group. Each operates in neighboring counties and may serve limited numbers of patients who reside within the service area through outreach or patient choice.

[TEXT] Local Hospitals, including Critical Access Hospitals.

[TEXT] There are no Critical Access Hospitals in the service area. Three hospital systems operate in Wake County; among them, WakeMed is the primary system serving the underserved population. WakeMed operates three hospitals within the area: the flagship WakeMed Raleigh Campus, WakeMed Cary Hospital, and WakeMed North Hospital in Raleigh.

[TEXT] ACH collaborates closely with the WakeMed system to support patient care coordination, including admissions, discharge planning, and follow-up. WakeMed also operates outpatient facilities in Raleigh, Garner, and Apex, which provide a range of services such as imaging, surgery, and emergency care. ACH maintains formal agreements with WakeMed for emergency medical services and hospitalist in-patient care for ACH patients.

[TEXT] These collaborative arrangements strengthen continuity of care, improve patient access to hospital-based and specialty services not available at ACH, and reduce the non-urgent use of hospital emergency departments.

[TEXT] Duke Health operates Duke Raleigh Hospital, a 204-bed facility located in Raleigh. The hospital provides a full range of services including cancer care, cardiovascular care, neuroscience, advanced gastrointestinal care, and wound healing. Duke Raleigh Hospital also maintains laboratory and imaging services, a pain clinic, 24/7 emergency care, community outreach, and education programs.

[TEXT] Through the RightCare (formerly Project Access) agreement, ACH collaborates with Duke Raleigh Hospital to support patient care, admissions, discharge planning, and follow-up. These arrangements enhance continuity of care across community providers, expand access to specialty services not available at ACH, and help reduce inappropriate emergency department utilization.

[TEXT] UNC REX Hospital, located in Raleigh and owned by the University of North Carolina Health Care System, also partners with ACH through the RightCare agreement to support patient care, admissions, discharge planning, and follow-up. In addition, UNC REX provides mobile mammography screenings for ACH patients. These collaborations collectively strengthen continuity of care across community providers, increase access to diagnostic and specialty services not available at ACH, and reduce non-urgent use of hospital emergency departments.

[TEXT] Other Providers and Programs Serving a Similar Population, including Specialty Providers. Beyond these hospital relationships, ACH maintains a range of formal and informal agreements with community partners that expand access to specialty care, diagnostic services, and enabling support services.

[TEXT] Recognizing that social drivers directly influences clinical outcomes, ACH tracks and addresses social risk factors through structured EHR fields and biopsychosocial assessments. At every patient visit, staff document housing instability, food insecurity, transportation barriers, and other social risks, and link patients to enabling services and community partners to reduce barriers and improve outcomes. Aggregate social drivers of health data informs community needs assessments and guide population level quality initiatives.

[TEXT] To sustain improvement and accountability, ACH conducts quarterly risk assessments including root-cause analyses of performance trends, identifying contributing factors and implementing targeted PDSA activities. This continuous learning cycle ensures that all services remain patient-centered, evidence-based, and responsive to the evolving needs of the community.

[TEXT] Over the next project period, ACH will continue to strengthen outcomes in the following priority areas:

[HEADING] a. Body Mass Index (BMI) screening and follow-up plan.

[TEXT] Body Mass Index (BMI) Screening and Follow-Up Plan (Adults, Age 18 and Older). Adult BMI screening and follow-up rates fluctuated during the same period but showed encouraging improvement in recent years. In 2020, 70.55% of adult patients had a documented BMI screening and follow-up plan when indicated. This measure declined to 39.24% in 2022 but improved to 52.17% in 2024. The number of adults receiving BMI screening increased from 4,764 in 2022 to 6,975 in 2024, demonstrating renewed focus on preventive care and chronic disease risk management.

[TEXT] The health center's performance improvement strategies include integrating BMI tracking into routine visits, establishing automated EHR reminders for follow-up counseling, and providing patient education on nutrition, weight management, and physical activity.

[TEXT] uses a mobile screening unit onsite monthly to expand outreach and increase compliance with screening guidelines. 2024, ACH strengthened its commitment to prevention by adding onsite mammography to its approved scope of project, further removing barriers to care for women in the service area. Mammography services will soon be offered directly by ACH, with the specific site currently under development. Cancer screening performance remains a top priority within ACH's QI Program, guided by data-driven strategies to improve screening rates, reduce disparities, and promote early diagnosis across all patient populations.

[TEXT] Breast Cancer Screening. Breast cancer screening rates showed meaningful improvement from 23.84% in 2020 to a peak of 42.84% in 2023, followed by a slight decline to 38.90% in 2024. The number of patients screened increased from 729 in 2020 to 1,092 in 2024. Performance gains were achieved through mobile mammography partnerships, community outreach events, and the integration of screening reminders within the EHR.

[TEXT] The slight decrease in 2024 likely reflects temporary barriers to access due to scheduling constraints and patient hesitancy post-pandemic. In response, ACH continues to emphasize patient education, navigation support, and reminder systems to maintain compliance with recommended screening intervals.

[TEXT] Cervical Cancer Screening. From 2020 through 2024, ACH demonstrated steady progress in cervical cancer screening rates, reflecting sustained efforts to improve women's preventive health. The percentage of eligible female patients screened increased from 34.71% in 2020 to 49.57% in 2024, with the number of patients screened rising from 1,737 to 3,094 during the same period. This upward trend underscores enhanced outreach, improved documentation, and expanded access to women's health services.

[TEXT] Key initiatives supporting this improvement include staff training on preventive care guidelines, use of EHR alerts for overdue screenings, and coordination with external laboratories to ensure timely reporting and data capture. ACH also expanded partnerships with OB/GYN providers at local hospitals to facilitate high- risk Pap testing for uninsured and underinsured patients. These combined strategies have significantly strengthened preventive care delivery and early detection for cervical cancer.

[TEXT] Colorectal Cancer Screening. Colorectal cancer screening rates experienced fluctuation during the reporting period but showed a notable rebound in 2024. The screening rate declined from 23.03% in 2020 to 13.76% in 2022, before improving to 25.17% in 2024. The number of patients screened followed a similar pattern, increasing from 724 in 2022 to 1,695 in 2024.

[TEXT] To strengthen performance in this measure, ACH expanded outreach and education around the importance of colorectal cancer screening, incorporated at-home FIT testing options, and enhanced follow-up tracking through the EHR. The health center also partnered with local specialists to streamline referrals for colonoscopy, ensuring timely completion of diagnostic procedures.

[HEADING] c. Diabetes and hypertension control.

[TEXT] ACH strives to decrease the percentage of patients 18-74 years of age with diabetes who had HbA1c levels greater than 9% (NOT under control). HbA1c >9% is an indicator of poor diabetes control, with a lower percentage representing better performance.

[TEXT] From 2020 through 2024, the percentage of patients diagnosed with diabetes has remained relatively stable overall, with modest year-to-year variation. In 2020, 25.40% of patients were identified as having diabetes, with a slight decline in 2021 (25.17%) and a subsequent rise to 28.23% in 2022. The percentage decreased to 23.82% in 2023, followed by an increase to 27.24% in 2024.

[TEXT] The number of diabetes patients followed a similar trend, ranging from 3,075 in 2020 to 3,339 in 2022, then decreasing to 2,975 in 2023 before climbing again to 3,084 in 2024. These shifts are influenced by factors such as patient turnover, expanded screening efforts, and improved diagnostic coding accuracy following the COVID-19 pandemic.

[TEXT] In response, ACH has continued to enhance its chronic disease management approach for patients with diabetes through expanded access to nutritional counseling, care coordination, medication management, and integrated behavioral health support. The center also leverages evidence-based tools and population health reports within the EHR to proactively identify patients with uncontrolled diabetes and engage them in follow-up care. Continued efforts are focused on improving HbA1c control rates and reducing diabetes- related complications across the patient population.

[TEXT] Comprehensive Diabetes Prevention and Education

[TEXT] Preventive health education, nutrition services, and chronic disease management are core components of ACH's patient-centered care model. Registered dietitians and nutritionists provide individualized counseling for patients managing diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, while group education sessions-known as Power Hours - offer interactive instruction on healthy eating, exercise, and lifestyle modification.

[TEXT] ACH promotes diabetes prevention and early detection through routine weight screenings for adults and children, annual bloodwork (including a comprehensive metabolic panel) for all overweight or obese patients, and same-day HbA1c testing for individuals with a family history or elevated risk factors. Patients receive tailored education on diabetes risk factors, prevention, and self-management through both individual and group sessions.

[TEXT] Health Educators conduct ongoing classes and workshops on chronic disease prevention and management. To address social drivers of health, ACH partners with Interfaith Food Shuttle to provide monthly fresh-food distributions at all sites, ensuring access to nutritious foods for patients and community

[TEXT] members. These integrated strategies improve health outcomes, strengthen community engagement, and reduce health disparities among the low-income populations served by ACH.

[TEXT] Diabetes: Hemoglobin A1c Poor Control (HbA1c > 9%). Diabetes control rates demonstrated variability during the 2020-2024 period, influenced in part by pandemic disruptions and care access challenges. In 2020, 43.12% of diabetic patients had poorly controlled HbA1c or no test documented. This percentage fluctuated between 25.76% and 27.43% in 2022-2023 before rising again to 44.23% in 2024. The number of patients with poor control mirrored these trends, from 1,326 in 2020 to 1,364 in 2024.

[TEXT] The 2024 increase likely reflects both improved screening and inclusion of new patients reestablishing care post-pandemic. In response, the health center has intensified its diabetes management efforts through point-of-care HbA1c testing, expanded access to registered dietitian, enhanced medication adherence programs, and team-based care that includes behavioral health support for lifestyle modification. The clinical leadership team continues to monitor diabetic control closely, with an emphasis on reducing the proportion of patients with HbA1c > 9% through coordinated care plans and continuous quality improvement initiatives.

[TEXT] Controlling High Blood Pressure (BP < 140/90 mmHg). Between 2020 and 2024, the percentage of patients diagnosed with hypertension within the health center's patient population demonstrated some fluctuation but remained a significant focus area for chronic disease management. In 2020, nearly half (49.92%) of medical patients presented with hypertension. This proportion gradually declined through 2023, reaching a low of 40.02%, before increasing again to 46.19% in 2024.

[TEXT] The total number of hypertension patients decreased from 6,344 in 2020 to 5,236 in 2023, followed by a modest increase to 5,464 in 2024. These changes may reflect several concurrent factors, including population shifts during the COVID-19 pandemic, enhanced screening and documentation processes, and expanded access to preventive and primary care services in subsequent years.

[TEXT] In response to these trends, the health center has strengthened its chronic disease management program through improved care coordination, the use of evidence-based treatment protocols, and proactive patient engagement strategies such as follow-up calls, home blood pressure monitoring, and nutrition education. Continued emphasis on hypertension control remains a clinical quality priority, with a focus on reducing complications and improving overall cardiovascular health among the patient population.

[TEXT] Between 2020 and 2024, the health center achieved a steady and significant improvement in hypertension control rates. In 2020, only 42.23% of patients with hypertension had controlled blood pressure. This measure increased each year, reaching 62.17% in 2024 - a 20-percentage point improvement over five years. The number of hypertensive patients with controlled blood pressure also grew from 2,679 in 2020 to 3,397 in 2024, reflecting enhanced chronic disease management and patient engagement.

[TEXT] This sustained progress is attributed to the implementation of evidence-based hypertension protocols, proactive outreach by care coordinators, improved medication adherence through pharmacy collaboration, and expanded access to home BP monitoring. Additionally, the use of EHR-based alerts and population health dashboards allowed care teams to identify and intervene with patients whose blood pressure readings were trending upward.

[TEXT] ACH will improve clinical quality and health outcomes by:

[TEXT] . Run a monthly report to identify patients with uncontrolled diabetes and hypertension who have not been to the clinic in the past 6 months with the goal of contacting those patients and bringing them back into the clinic.

[TEXT] . Involving the whole team in the care of the patients (Nursing, APPs, Doctors, LCSWs, and Nutritionists) to help the patients improve their diabetes and hypertension.

[TEXT] . Ensure that patients are being followed by the same primary care provider on their visits and that they are seen at least every 3 months until their diabetes and hypertension are well controlled.

[HEADING] d. Screening for depression and follow-up planning, including depression remission.

[TEXT] ACH supports a fully integrated model of primary and behavioral health care, wherein patients receive behavioral health screenings, appropriate referral to treatment, and ongoing support for the collaborative plan of care by medical providers. ACH uses the PHQ-2 or PHQ-9, GAD-7, PCL-PTSD, and Bio-Physical Assessments to screen patients for depression at intake. Staff enter results in the EHR, which are reviewed by the provider with referral for in-house or outside behavioral health services as indicated. Patients may be reluctant to complete depression screening or may not be truthful in responses due to the impact of stigma regarding mental health conditions. Providers will educate the patient regarding the benefits of screening and the health center's commitment to confidentiality.

[TEXT] Depression Screening and Follow-Up Plan. From 2020 through 2024, the health center demonstrated consistent improvement in screening for depression and ensuring follow-up plans for patients with positive results. In 2020, 71.00% of patients were screened and had a documented follow-up plan when indicated. Despite a temporary decline in 2021 (57.28%), reflecting the operational disruptions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, performance rebounded in subsequent years, rising steadily to 74.94% in 2024. The number of patients screened increased significantly from 8,259 in 2020 to 11,513 in 2024, underscoring the center's success in integrating behavioral health services into primary care workflows.

[TEXT] Behavioral health needs have increased sharply, particularly among adolescents and working-age adults. In response, ACH has expanded its integrated behavioral health model, embedding licensed clinicians within primary care teams to provide same-day consultations, brief therapy, and medication management. This co-located approach enhances early identification of behavioral health concerns and reduces stigma and delays in treatment.

[TEXT] This improvement is attributed to the implementation of standardized screening tools (PHQ-2 and PHQ-9) within the EHR, provider training on behavioral health integration, and the availability of LCSWs across all service sites. The center also strengthened its referral pathways and documentation practices to ensure timely follow-up for patients with positive screens, particularly within the Health Care for the Homeless and high-risk populations.

[TEXT] Depression Remission at Twelve Months. While year-to-year performance in depression remission varied, the data reflect ongoing progress toward achieving long-term behavioral health outcomes. After establishing baseline reporting in 2021 (11.05%), remission rates increased to 16.24% in 2023 before moderating to 10.04% in 2024.

[TEXT] . Provide staff with ongoing education on trauma-informed care, motivational interviewing, and suicide prevention protocols.

[TEXT] People experiencing homelessness often face significant barriers to accessing behavioral health services, including the absence of family or social support networks that can assist them in seeking or maintaining care. To address these challenges, ACH employs LCSWs who rotate among all service sites to ensure consistent behavioral health access for all patients, including those served through the HCH program.

[TEXT] ACH provides targeted support for homeless patients experiencing co-occurring substance use disorders. LCSWs work closely with medical providers to develop individualized, comprehensive plans of care that address both behavioral and physical health needs. Through this integrated approach, ACH ensures that vulnerable populations, particularly those experiencing homelessness, receive coordinated, patient- centered behavioral health services designed to promote stability, recovery, and improved quality of life.

[HEADING] e. Tobacco use screening and cessation intervention.

[TEXT] Tobacco use screening and cessation intervention. From 2020 through 2024, ACH consistently maintained high performance in screening adult patients for tobacco use and providing cessation interventions when indicated. In 2020, 96.15% of patients aged 12 and older were screened and counseled on tobacco use. Although there was a temporary decline in 2021 (82.62%) - largely due to pandemic- related disruptions and reduced in-person visits - performance steadily improved in the following years, reaching 91.52% in 2024.

[TEXT] The total number of adult medical patients screened increased from 7,522 in 2020 to 9,733 in 2024, reflecting ACH's renewed focus on preventive health measures and robust documentation practices. The health center's providers integrate tobacco screening and cessation counseling into routine visits using standardized EHR prompts and evidence-based counseling protocols.

[TEXT] ACH's proposed FY 2026 Service Area Competition budget is consistent across all required documents - including the SF-424A, Budget Narrative, and Project Narrative - and fully aligns with the proposed work plan, projected patient growth, and HRSA-approved scope of project. Developed in accordance with HRSA guidance and Uniform Guidance (45 CFR Part 75), the budget demonstrates fiscal discipline and an efficient, outcomes-driven service delivery model that reflects both HRSA and Make America Healthy Again priorities: expanding access, improving outcomes, and advancing health equity through sustainable community care. The allocation of resources is strategically designed to maximize the impact of each federal dollar while upholding the highest standards of quality, accountability, and measurable improvement in patient outcomes.

[TEXT] The Service Area Announcement Table identifies a patient target of 21,538, consistent with the number of unduplicated patients served in calendar year 2024. ACH anticipates exceeding this baseline in the

[TEXT] Project Narrative Fiscal Year 2026 Service Area Competition HRSA-26-004 upcoming project period, projecting service to approximately 56,003 unduplicated patients based on continued organizational growth.

[TEXT] This increase will be achieved through the expansion of medical, dental, and behavioral health services and service sites. ACH has structured its operating model to scale efficiently and sustainably within the SAAT-announced funding level by leveraging existing infrastructure, cross-trained staff, and collaborative partnerships. Projected growth in patient volume will result from optimized scheduling, enhanced care coordination, and the continued integration of quality improvement initiatives that strengthen access and patient outcomes.

[TEXT] The proportion of federal funds requested is appropriate and aligned with ACH's payer mix and the high proportion of uninsured and underinsured patients across the Wake and Franklin County service area, including Health Care for the Homeless patients. ACH operates a high-value, patient-centered delivery system that remains the region's primary safety net provider. The proposed budget represents a balanced and sustainable financial plan in which projected expenses do not exceed anticipated revenues from program income, grants, and other funding sources. Federal support per patient remains reasonable and justified given the area's substantial unmet needs, the breadth of services provided, and the investments required to maintain equitable access for diverse and underserved populations.

[TEXT] The plan reflects sound financial stewardship consistent with HRSA's Financial Management and Accounting Systems requirements (45 CFR Part 75 Subpart D; Compliance Manual Ch. 15). Federal funds are dedicated to allowable costs that directly support the approved scope of services and expected patient increases. ACH's internal controls, procurement, and reporting systems ensure funds are managed responsibly and in full compliance with Uniform Guidance. Budgets are reviewed monthly by the CFO, CEO, leadership team, and Board of Trustees to verify alignment between expenditures, performance, patient growth, and quality metrics.

[TEXT] ACH continues to implement organization-wide efficiency measures, such as participation in group purchasing organizations, negotiated vendor and service contracts, and centralized procurement and inventory controls under 45 CFR §§ 75.326 -. 335 - ensuring every federal dollar achieves maximum community benefit. ACH also maximizes reimbursement from Medicaid, Medicare, and other third-party sources while maintaining full compliance with HRSA's Sliding Fee Discount Program to guarantee that care remains accessible regardless of ability to pay.

[TEXT] For more than half a century (53-years) of exceptional service and measurable community health gains, ACH remains the region's most effective mechanism for addressing persistent gaps in medical, dental, and behavioral health/substance use care. The proposed HRSA investment will be used efficiently to preserve access to comprehensive, patient-focused, and community-responsive care that advances MAHA's mission of healthier people, stronger families, and thriving communities. Without ACH's integrated health and enabling services, many residents would go without essential care - resulting in preventable illness, higher costs, and broader social consequences.

[HEADING] ADVANCE COMMUNITY HEALTH, INC. Non-Profit 501(c)(3) Corporation

[TEXT] The Mission of Advance Community Health Inc. (the "Corporation") is to deliver quality, compassionate primary healthcare - every patient, every time - in response to the needs of our communities. The Corporation provides services primarily to residents of Wake and Franklin counties; however, the Corporation cares for all, regardless of insurance status or ability to pay.

[HEADING] ARTICLE I. OFFICES

[TEXT] The Corporation may have such offices as the Board of Trustees may determine or as the affairs of the Corporation may require from time to time.

[HEADING] ARTICLE II. BOARD OF TRUSTEES

[TEXT] Section 1. General Powers. The Corporation is organized pursuant to North Carolina General Statutes, Chapter 55A (Nonprofit Corporation Act), and the affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by the Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees shall, always, ensure that the Corporation operates in compliance with the laws of the State of North Carolina and with the federal rules and regulations that govern the funding and operation of community health centers. The Board of Trustees shall always reserve full authority. No individual, entity or committee, at any time, has approval or veto authority over the Board. The Board of Trustees shall operate in concert with the organization's fiscal year (April 1 - March 31).

[TEXT] Section 2. Number and Qualifications. The Corporation shall have two categories of Trustees, "patients" and "non-patients." The definition of "patient" includes any person (or their parent/legal guardian) who has utilized the Corporation as their principal source of primary or dental care within the last two years. A non-patient shall be defined as a representative of the community in the Corporation's service area.

[TEXT] The Board of Trustees shall be a self-perpetuating body with vacancies being filled by a majority vote of the members present at a duly constituted meeting of the Board of Trustees. At least fifty- one percent (51%) of board members shall be patients who shall be representative of the Corporation's patient demographics in terms of age, race, ethnicity and gender. The patient board members shall be representative of the various practice locations and communities served and shall be selected in keeping with federal rules and regulations that govern the funding and administration of healthcare centers. The Corporation receives special population funding, and at a minimum there shall be at least one Board member who represents persons who are experiencing homelessness.

[TEXT] The remaining members of the Board of Trustees shall be non-patients who, generally selected for their expertise, shall also be selected in keeping with the federal rules and regulations that govern the funding and administration of healthcare centers. The Corporation shall, always, strive to

[TEXT] maintain balance between patients and non-patients Trustees, making every effort to achieve 49% non-patient representation on the board. No more than fifty percent (50%) of the non-patient Trustees may be individuals who derive greater than 10% of their annual income from the healthcare industry. Specifically, "individuals who derive their income from the healthcare industry" are defined as persons currently employed in organizations who provide primary healthcare, specialty services, hospital or rehabilitative services, including solo or private practice. The definition does not include persons retired from those organizations. Non-patient board members shall live or work in the Corporation's service area.

[TEXT] The number of Trustees shall be at least nine (9) and no more than seventeen (17) except when it becomes necessary or desirable to increase the size of the Board to accommodate additional practice sites, communities or expertise. In such case, the Corporation shall increase the size of the Board by no greater than two (2) additional members, one seat being designated for a patient and one for a non-patient. At no time shall the number of Trustees be greater than twenty-five (25).

[TEXT] No member of the Board of Trustees shall be a contractor of the organization. No member of the Board of Trustees shall be an employee of the Corporation, or be related by blood, marriage, or adoption to an employee of the Corporation.

[TEXT] Dear Administrator Engels:

[TEXT] I write regarding Advance Community Health's FY26 Service Area Competition (SAC) application for grant funding under Section 330 of the Public Health Services Act. Since 1972, Advance Community Health has delivered high-quality, comprehensive health care to our community. The work of Advance Community Health's dedicated staff provides health care services to many residents who, without the health center, would have limited access to care.

[TEXT] Advance Community Health, a non-proft community health center, provides accessible, affordable, high-quality, patient-focused primary health care to residents of Wake and Franklin counties. With federal grant support, Advance Community Health is able to provide comprehensive health care services that improve outcomes for residents across its service area. By increasing access to comprehensive primary care and prevention in a family practice setting, the organization's health center helps to ensure that patients are able to seek care earlier and avoid more serious, sometimes life-threatening health consequences which require more costly medical interventions.

[TEXT] For the reasons listed above, I urge your full and fair consideration of Advance Community Health's application to receive Section 330 funding. Please do not hesitate to contact my office for additional information about Advance Community Health and its exceptional work in our community.

[TEXT] Very truly yours,

[TEXT] Dear Mr. McCray,

[TEXT] Advance Community Health and Lincoln Community Health Center (LCHC) have worked collaboratively to meet the needs of Durham and Wake Counties. This partnership has served to increase access to services to local residents. Lincoln fully supports Advance Community Health's receipt of federal Section 330 funding.

[TEXT] The collaboration between our organizations meets a number of needs for low-income and uninsured residents in the community. Lincoln provides primary care (Pediatrics, Adult, and Family Medicine), behavioral health, medication assisted treatment, dental, health education, case management, substance use, pharmacy, laboratory, and radiology services to residents. Advance Community Health provides high-quality healthcare services that include primary care, substance use care, dental care, as well as case management and health education. Because of the high prevalence of poverty in our area, these services are critical to meeting the healthcare needs of the population. The collaborative relationship between our two organizations has helped identify the needs of patients and ensure access to services that meet those needs. Together with other community partner organizations, Advance Community Health plays a key part in improving the health, well-being, and overall quality of life for area residents.

[TEXT] LCHC considers Advance Community Health's provision of affordable healthcare services as invaluable to the region, and we look forward to continuing our collaboration. LCHC fully supports Advance Community Health's application for Section 330 funding.

[TEXT] Dear Mr. McCray,

[TEXT] Piedmont Health would like to offer its full support for Advance Community Health's application for federal Section 330 Service Area Competition (SAC, HRSA-26-004). Since 1972, Advance Community Health has delivered high-quality, comprehensive health care to our community. The work of Advance Community Health's dedicated staff provides health care services to many residents who, without the health center, would have limited access to care.

[TEXT] Like Advance Community Health, Piedmont Health also works to serve local residents and understands not only the great need in the area, but also the role and impact of community service organizations. For years, our organizations, along with others, have worked in partnership to meet local needs, whether they be social or medical. Each community organization has its role, and that shared responsibility and willingness to work together has served to improve the overall wellbeing of the population. Advance's role in particular has improved the health of residents through the provision not only of primary care, but also preventative screenings, health education and the promotion of a healthy lifestyle. By improving the daily health of residents, Advance lowers the risk of complications of serious, often life-threatening diseases and therefore reduces the need for and cost of providing acute care - a valuable service for the community as a whole but especially for the uninsured and low-income residents otherwise unable to afford medical care.

[TEXT] Piedmont Health is proud to continue sharing this responsibility through an ongoing mutual referral relationship with Advance and through continued collaboration in identifying and meeting local needs. As such, Piedmont Health believes strongly that the provision of Section 330 funding to Advance Community Health will have a positive impact in Wake and Franklin counties.

[HEADING] Sliding Fee Discount Program

[TEXT] Compliant; Required Attachments and Forms: Attachment 10: Sliding Fee Discount Schedule(s), Form 5A: Services Provided

[HEADING] Compliance Narrative:

[TEXT] Describe the following aspects of the SFDP: Uniform applicability to all patients. Definitions of income and family. Alignment with the current FPG. Methods for assessing all patients for sliding fee discount eligibility based only on income and family size. Assurance that patient charges are adjusted based on ability to pay and consistent with the SFDS. Policies related to nominal charges for patients with incomes at or below 100 percent of the current FPG.

[TEXT] How you assess all patients for sliding fee discount eligibility based only on income and family size. See income definition in Chapter 9: Sliding Fee Discount Program of the Compliance Manual.

[TEXT] ACH provides services according to a Board approved SFDP based solely on income and family size, consistent with Chapter 9 of HRSA's Compliance Manual. The SFDS applies to patients with incomes up to 200% of the FPG.

[TEXT] ACH utilizes written policies and procedures to implement the SFDS. These policies and procedures define income and family size, specify documentation or verification requirements for determining and recording family size and income, detail the specific structure for the SFDS itself, establish the frequency for re-evaluation of patient eligibility, and address provisions for waiving fees and nominal charges for specific patient circumstances.

[TEXT] Family size and income are verified using official documentation to determine wages and salary, excluding assets and other similar items, consistent with HRSA definitions. These figures are compared to the annually published FPG. ACH follows HRSA's definition of "family," which is a group of two or more persons related by birth, marriage, or adoption who live together; all such related persons are considered members of one family.

[TEXT] Eligibility determinations are conducted respectfully, confidentially, and in a culturally appropriate manner to avoid barriers to care. Acceptable income documentation includes recent pay stubs, tax returns, or other verifiable proof of earnings; assets are not considered.

[TEXT] All patients are made aware of the SFDP via the Patient Registration Form, which is completed by all new patients, and updated annually. Signs in multiple languages are posted near the front desk area of all locations providing information about the SFDP. When patients inquire about or are invited to apply for the Sliding Fee Discount Program, front-office staff and Patient Financial Navigators provide assistance with completing the application. Applications are reviewed and updated annually, or sooner if there is a change in household income or size. For patients who are unemployed, report zero income, or are homeless or transitioning from homelessness, eligibility is re-evaluated every six months to ensure continued accuracy.

[TEXT] Attachment 13: Health Center Program Compliance Service Area Competition HRSA-26-004

[TEXT] Patients without income documentation may self-declare income for one visit per year; documentation must be provided at the next visit or the patient is classified as self-pay.

[TEXT] For homeless individuals, ACH follows Section 330 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. § 254b) and Bureau of Primary Health Care definitions of homelessness. Per guidance, an individual may be considered homeless if they are "doubled up" with others, or if they are a previously homeless person being discharged from a hospital, prison, or similar institution without stable housing to return to. All patients who identify as homeless, regardless of insurance status, must provide documentation of their homeless status consistent with this definition. Acceptable documentation includes a certification letter from a shelter or social service agency or correlating verification forms such as household instability or "doubled-up" documentation. This documentation is attached to the patient's SFDP application to ensure eligibility determination aligns with HRSA requirements.

[TEXT] ACH's Practice Management System calculates the percentage of FPG based on income and family size and flags records for review. Eligibility is re-verified annually, and the Chief Financial Officer and Practice Managers audit files to ensure accuracy and adherence to policy.

[TEXT] How you adjust patient charges based on the ability to pay. ACH adjusts patient charges based on ability to pay through its Board-approved SFDP. Discounts are applied using a SFDS aligned with the most recent FPG and determined by verified household income and family size.

[TEXT] The SFDP applies to all individuals and families with annual incomes between 100% and 200% of the FPG. Discounts (flat or percentage-based) are applied consistently across all service types, including medical, behavioral health, dental, nursing, nutrition, pharmacy, urgent care, integrated care, and OB/GYN.

[TEXT] Patients with annual incomes at or below 100% of the FPG are charged only a nominal fee, while those between 101% and 200% of the FPG receive graduated discounts. The SFDS includes four pay classes above 100% FPG - 101-125%, 126-150%, 151-175%, and 176-200%. No sliding fee discount is approved for individuals or families with incomes exceeding 200% of the FPG.

[TEXT] All services are billed at their full established charge, and discounts are applied according to each patient's verified eligibility level. Uninsured patients and those who are underinsured (with self-pay balances such as co-payments or deductibles) are encouraged to apply for the SFDP.

[TEXT] Eligibility is determined and documented annually, based on verification of income and household size, and reassessed whenever a change in financial circumstances occurs. ACH ensures that no patient is denied care due to inability to pay, thereby maintaining equitable access to all health center services.

[TEXT] Each year, the Board of Trustees, comprised of a patient-majority membership, reviews and approves the SFDS to incorporate the most recent FPG. As part of this review, the Board evaluates the structure and effectiveness of the discount schedule to ensure it continues to reduce financial barriers to care. This includes reviewing UDS data, practice management system financial reports, and patient

[TEXT] satisfaction survey results to assess whether patients across all discount pay classes are accessing care.

[TEXT] In conjunction with this annual review, ACH's policies and procedures governing implementation of the sliding fee scale are also reviewed and updated as needed to ensure continued compliance with HRSA's Sliding Fee Discount Program requirements.

[TEXT] Whether you have a nominal charge for patients with incomes at or below 100% of the FPG. ACH applies a nominal flat fee for patients with incomes at or below 100% of the FPG and does not reflect the cost of the service provided. The nominal fee is intended solely to encourage shared responsibility and not to create a financial barrier to care. Examples (effective 05/01/2025-03/31/2026) include: $40 for medical or behavioral health visits; $60 for dental visits; $10 for nurse visits; $17 for nutrition services; $10.50 for pharmacy dispensing; $125 for urgent care visits; $75 for integrated care visits; and Fee per procedure for OB/GYN.

All contracts and agreements are executed in accordance with ACH's Contracts and Subawards Policy, which ensures compliance with federal procurement standards (45 CFR Part 75 Subpart D) and includes provisions for conflict of interest, cost reasonableness, and documentation of services rendered.

[TEXT] Only the CEO and individuals specifically authorized in writing may bind ACH to contractual relationships. The Finance Department maintains centralized records of all contracts, and the CFO oversees fiscal and compliance monitoring of each agreement. Where appropriate, ACH consults with external legal counsel to ensure that all contracts comply with applicable federal, state, and local laws as well as funding-source requirements.

[TEXT] The CFO oversees HCP grant funds. Sage Intacct serves as the organization's accounting platform, supporting the general ledger, payroll, payables, and reporting functions. ACH's accounting system provides for separate identification of federal and non-federal transactions and maintains a chart of accounts that allows for detailed tracking of all revenues and expenses. Financial controls, drawdown procedures, and accounting for contracts and subawards are governed by ACH's Financial Management and Accounting Systems policies.

[TEXT] ACH operates independently and does not have a parent organization, subsidiary, or corporate affiliation agreements. ACH does not utilize subrecipients to carry out programmatic elements of the project. All contractual relationships are governed by written agreements outlining the scope of services, reporting expectations, payment terms, and performance monitoring requirements. ACH monitors and evaluates contractor performance to ensure adherence to quality, compliance, and fiscal accountability standards.

[TEXT] · Your board-approved policies, as well as your procedures for waiving or reducing fees, to ensure that fees or payments will be waived or reduced based on specific circumstances due to any patient's inability to pay.

[TEXT] ACH participates in Medicare, Medicaid, and the North Carolina Health Choice (CHIP) programs, as well as a wide range of commercial and managed care insurance plans. Trained Outreach and Enrollment Specialists and Patient Financial Navigators assist patients in enrolling in public and private coverage programs, including Marketplace plans, ensuring equitable access to care regardless of income or insurance status.

[TEXT] Billing and collections are centralized within the Finance Department, which oversees insurance verification, charge capture, claims submission, payment posting, and follow-up. ACH utilizes Epic as its electronic health record and patient accounting system, integrated with a clearinghouse for electronic claims submission and remittance processing. Standardized billing workflows and payer-specific protocols ensure accuracy, compliance, and timely reimbursement.

[TEXT] ACH maintains board-approved Billing and Collections and SFDP policies to ensure that inability to pay is never a barrier to care. All patients are assessed for SFDP eligibility based on household income and family size, consistent with FPG. Fees are waived or reduced according to the SFDS, which is reviewed and approved annually by the Board of Trustees.

[TEXT] In accordance with HRSA requirements, no patient is denied services due to inability to pay. To prevent financial hardship, ACH works with patients to establish affordable payment plans when needed. When nominal fees pose a burden, waivers or alternative arrangements may be approved by the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Medical Officer, or Director of Patient Financial Services, based on requests from practice managers or providers.

[TEXT] These systems and policies ensure compliance with HRSA and federal regulations, maintain revenue integrity, and uphold ACH's mission to provide affordable, accessible, and equitable care to all patients regardless of their ability to pay.
