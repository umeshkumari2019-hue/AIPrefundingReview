CCHC sites will include:\n\n[TEXT] 1. Sapuk Health Center, on the northern East tip of the island, will be housed in an unused section of a Roosevelt building, provided in-kind through an free lease by Roosevelt family. Target community: Sapuk Village (1197 residents), Penia Village (487 residents), Peniesene Village (551 residents) and Tunnuk Village (780 residents). Total combined population: 3,015.\n\n[TEXT] 2. Neou Health Center, on the southern West tip of the island, will be housed in facilities previously occupied by the Sephet William family. Target community: Neou Village (1385 residents), Wichap Village (1,233 residents), Epinup Village (333 residents), Mwan Village (1,417 residents). Total combine population: 4,368.\n\n[TEXT] 3. Nepukos Health Center, on the main business thoroughfare and urban center of Weno, the Nepukos site is one mile from the hospital and public health programs, 3/4 miles from the Chuuk High School and the College of Micronesia-FSM, and immediately adjacent to the State's primary landing port for Chuuk residents traveling from neighboring islands, often seeking health services. Target population Chuuk High School (1,200 students); College of Micronesia-FSM (800 students); Nepukos Village (2314 residents), Iras Village (2511 residents). The Nepukos site will serve as the main administrative offices for the CCHC.\n\n[TEXT] Both the Sapuk and Neou facilities are provided in-kind by Roosevelt family and Sephet William family through free lease. The Nepukos CHC is on the first floor of a government owned building previously occupied by the American Red Cross. It will be provided in-kind by Chuuk State. Once renovated, all three sites will have roughly similar functional spaces, including exam rooms, consultation rooms, a reception area, space for administrative activities and space for medical records, laboratory and pharmaceuticals which, for some sites, be folded into reception areas with counters and furniture creating appropriate partitions. All three sites have portable dental chair.\n\n[TEXT] Hours of Operation - Nepukos, Sapuk, and Neou each be open at least forty hours per week, during usual business hours, Monday through Friday, with evening hours on at least one weekday and one half day on Saturday. The CCHC Board will determine the precise schedule for each site.\n\n[TEXT] Funding Opportunity Number: HRSA-26-004 Received Date: 12/3/2025 4:49:01 PM\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 6 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 243095\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: 6 H80CS30720-09-03\n\n[TEXT] After Hours Coverage - Chuuk State Hospital has a 24-hour emergency room and one ambulance. The hospital is 90 and 60 minutes from both Sapuk and Neou communities, respectively. In addition, community health workers, doctors and nurses be assigned at Sapuk and Neou so that at least one CHC staff member will reside within the catchment area and be available for urgent calls after usual clinic hours.

FSM is in a special relationship of free association with the United States and exists outside all U.S. congressional districts. The Chuuk Department of Health Services (CDHS), established in 1948, is the only health care provider in Chuuk State, and is responsible for operating the State Hospital, and together with the Chuuk CHC (currently a public center) for providing all primary care and preventative health services for the island population. Discussion is currently underway between the Chuuk CHC Governing Board and the Chuuk Department of Health Services regarding the Chuuk CHC becoming a separate stand alone entity. Service Area/Target Population - The Chuuk CHC (CCHC) project service area is the 7 square miles of Weno Island, in Chuuk State. The service area of CCHC is the entire island population of 13,856 people. Non-communicable diseases continue are the top five causes of Morbidity and mortality in Chuuk Sate. Hospital admission for diabetes (as the primary diagnosis) rose from 51/10,000 in 2012 to 78/10,000 in 2013. Admission for hypertension also increased from 52/10,000 in 2012 to 68/10,000 in 2013. Governor Elimo Johnson declared a State of Emergency for NCDs in 2011 in response to the dramatic rise of new cases and serious costly complications. Nearly 2/3 of Chuuk service budget Chuuk Hospital is spent on secondary and tertiary care for NCD patients. Other serious health problems include high teen pregnancy rate (ten times US rates and among the highest in the world); infant mortality (five times US rate and the highest in FSM), anemia among pregnant women (six times the US rate), and late prenatal care (88% in third trimester compared to 17% in US); communicable diseases tied to limited clean water and unsanitary waste disposal leading to skin diseases, gastroenteritis, amoeba, and a constant burden of intestinal helminths that contribute to childhood malnutrition, anemia, and premature births; high rates of alcohol, and tobacco use compared to the US; and very poor dental outcomes. Chuuk CHC Project - The CCHC service delivery model has been designed to make available and provide primary health care services on the Chuuk island of Weno from just one location - the hospital, to one that is proactive and moves services into the community. The model responds to the steady decrement in US Federal Compact Health Sector funding and in particular addresses the crippling cost of caring for patients with complications of NCDs by shifting emphasis strongly toward the most cost-effective activities: preventive services and provision of basic primary care. The CCHC will have three main delivery sites equidistant around the island, providing the Weno population with primary medical, dental, behavioral health, cancer screening (pap smear & mammogram) and enabling services that are within 30 to 60 minutes walking distance for most of the population. Each of the three clinic sites (in the villages of Nepukos, Neou and Sapuk) will be staffed by physicians, nurses, and community health workers (CHWs). who are trained in both clinical and behavioral health. In addition, each site will have regularly scheduled well-child, antenatal, prenatal, women's cancer screening and NCD clinics in partnership with Chuuk Public Health. The sites will\n\n[TEXT] Funding Opportunity Number: HRSA-26-004 Received Date: 12/3/2025 4:49:01 PM\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 8 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 243095\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: 6 H80CS30720-09-03\n\n[TEXT] share a dentist and dental assistant who will rotate among the 3 sites on a regular basis, a Case Manager charged with coordinating CHC with Public Health registries; a van driver who will maintain a daily route among all sites and the hospital; and management and administrative staff. In addition, the Nepukos site will have a pharmacy technician to dispense medications at this site. From January 1 - December 31, 2024 the current CCHC has served 4,569 medical patients, with 6,116 medical encounters during this period ..\n\n[TEXT] Funding Opportunity Number: HRSA-26-004 Received Date: 12/3/2025 4:49:01 PM\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 10 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] OMB Number: 4040-0010 Expiration Date: 12/31/2026\n\n[HEADING] Key Contacts Form\n\n[TEXT] * Applicant Organization Name: Chuuk State Department of Health Services\n\n[TEXT] Enter the individual's role on the project (e.g., project manager, fiscal contact).\n\n[TEXT] * Contact 1 Project Role:\n\n[TEXT] Inouefich Shomour\n\n[TEXT] Prefix:\n\n[TEXT] Ms .\n\n[TEXT] * First Name:\n\n[TEXT] Inouefich\n\n[TEXT] Middle Name:\n\n[TEXT] * Last Name:\n\n[TEXT] Shomour\n\n[TEXT] Suffix:\n\n[TEXT] Title:\n\n[TEXT] Chief Executive Officer\n\n[TEXT] Organizational Affiliation:\n\n[TEXT] * Street1:\n\n[TEXT] 100 Nepukos Street\n\n[TEXT] Street2:\n\n[TEXT] * City:\n\n[TEXT] Chuuk\n\n[TEXT] County:\n\n[TEXT] * State:\n\n[TEXT] FM: Federated States of Micronesia\n\n[TEXT] Province:\n\n[TEXT] * Country:\n\n[TEXT] USA: UNITED STATES\n\n[TEXT] * Zip / Postal Code:\n\n[TEXT] 96942-9997\n\n[TEXT] * Telephone Number:\n\n[TEXT] 6919304225\n\n[TEXT] Fax:\n\n[TEXT] * Email:\n\n[TEXT] harushima81@gmail.com\n\n[TEXT] Funding Opportunity Number:HRSA-26-004 Received Date:Oct 15, 2025 11:19:29 AM EDT\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 243095\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: 6 H80CS30720-09-03\n\n[TEXT] Skip to Main Content\n\n[HEADING] Project/Performance Site Location(s)\n\n[TEXT] Project/Performance Site Primary Location\n\n[TEXT] Organization Name: Chuuk Community Health Center\n\n[TEXT] * Street1:\n\n[TEXT] 100 Nepukos Street\n\n[TEXT] Street2:\n\n[TEXT] * City: Chuuk\n\n[TEXT] County:\n\n[TEXT] Chuuk\n\n[TEXT] *\n\n[TEXT] State:\n\n[TEXT] Federated States of Micronesia\n\n[TEXT] * Country\n\n[TEXT] United States\n\n[TEXT] 96942-9997\n\n[TEXT] UEI: FM42ZXRZ11L1 Project/ Performance Site Congressional District: 00\n\n[HEADING] Project/Performance Site Location\n\n[TEXT] Organization Name:\n\n[TEXT] Chuuk Community Health Center\n\n[TEXT] * Street1:\n\n[TEXT] 125 Neuo Street\n\n[TEXT] Street2:\n\n[TEXT] * City: Chuuk\n\n[TEXT] * State:\n\n[TEXT] Federated States of Micronesia\n\n[TEXT] * Country\n\n[TEXT] United States\n\n[TEXT] 96942-9997\n\n[TEXT] UEI:\n\n[TEXT] FM42ZXRZ11L1\n\n[TEXT] Project/ Performance Site Congressional District:\n\n[TEXT] County:\n\n[TEXT] Province:\n\n[TEXT] Project/Performance Site Location\n\n[TEXT] Organization Name: Chuuk Community Health Center\n\n[TEXT] * Street1:\n\n[TEXT] Roosevelt Road\n\n[TEXT] Street2:\n\n[TEXT] * City: Chuuk\n\n[TEXT] * State:\n\n[TEXT] Federated States of Micronesia\n\n[TEXT] * Country United States\n\n[TEXT] 96942-9997\n\n[TEXT] UEI: FM42ZXRZ11L1\n\n[TEXT] Project/ Performance Site Congressional District:\n\n[TEXT] County:\n\n[TEXT] Province:\n\n[TEXT] OMB Approval No. 4040-0010 Expiration Date 11/30/2025\n\n[TEXT] Province:\n\n[TEXT] * ZIP / Postal Code:\n\n[TEXT] * ZIP / Postal Code:\n\n[TEXT] * ZIP / Postal Code:\n\n[TEXT] Funding Opportunity Number: HRSA-26-004 Received Date: 12/3/2025 4:49:01 PM\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 11 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 243095\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: 6 H80CS30720-09-03\n\n[HEADING] Project Narrative\n\n[TEXT] The Chuuk State Department of Health Services and the Chuuk Community Health Center Governing Board jointly submit this SAC application for a multi-site community health center in Chuuk State, in the Federated States of Micronesia. First established in 2016, this \"public center\" is adapted to Chuuk's unique geographic, social, cultural, economic and health conditions.\n\n[HEADING] INTRODUCTION\n\n[TEXT] For those unfamiliar with the Federated States of Micronesia and its unique trust relationship with the United States, a brief overview will help place this application in its proper context. The Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) consists of the four states of Pohnpei, Chuuk, Kosrae and Yap, with a total of 108,000 individuals living on 607 islands and atolls that span a distance of 1,500 miles-roughly equivalent to 3/4 of the width of the Continental United States-and that in total equal 276 square miles of land. The islands that now make up FSM formally began their association with the United States in 1947, when the United Nations appointed the US as a trustee of what became the Trust Territories of the Pacific Islands (TTPI). The TTPI also included the Marshall Islands, Palau, and the Northern Mariana Islands. This trusteeship obligated the United States to promote self-governance along with social, educational and economic advancement of the inhabitants of the TTPI. To this end, FSM achieved independence in 1979 but maintains a special relationship of free-association with the United States. This relationship enables FSM to receive direct economic support from the US and to participate in many-though not all-of the rights, benefits and responsibilities of US citizens, including free migration to and from the United States and eligibility for select domestic assistance programs, such as the 330(e) Community Health Center program (but not Medicaid or Medicare). In addition, citizens of the FSM serve as soldiers in the US military. In exchange for this support, FSM and the other Pacific Basin jurisdictions grant the United States various forms of political oversight, the most significant being the right to exercise strategic denial to the military forces of other nations and to retain military control of more than half a million square miles of the Pacific. Chuuk is the most easterly state of FSM and is nearly 6,000 miles and a sixteen hour plane ride from California.\n\n[TEXT] 1\n\n[TEXT] Map of Federated States of Micronesia and Chuuk State\n\n[HEADING] Chuuk\n\n[TEXT] Received Date: 12/3/2025 4:49:01 PM\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 12 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 243095\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: 6 H80CS30720-09-03\n\n[HEADING] Chuuk\n\n[TEXT] Federated States of Micronesia\n\n[TEXT] .

The 15 islands of the Chuuk Lagoon have a total land area of 39 square miles; and the lagoon itself has a total surface area of 822 square miles. Because of the vast expanse of water between islands, travel within the State of Chuuk is difficult. Within the lagoon, travel by boat from Weno to any of the other islands takes from 1.5 hours to 2 hours. Access to the outer islands is even more difficult with travel times on a cargo ship taking from four hours up to two days.1\n\n[TEXT] NEED\n\n[HEADING] 1.

Factors associated with care access and utilization\n\n[TEXT] · Geographical/transportation barriers - Transportation is a significant barrier to primary health care access. Sixty percent (60%) of households have no transportation. While the literal distance between a village and the current health care site might appear insignificant on a map (or to one unfamiliar with local conditions), traveling between villages is actually quite difficult due to limited or lack of roadways. No public transportation exists with the exception of taxi services.\n\n[TEXT] Together with limited cash income, this results in frequent neglect of medical problems until they become severe and warrant a trip to the hospital. Delayed presentations or late requests for medical help, usually result in increased suffering on behalf of the patient, and increased costs to alleviate or cure. In a society that has existed for hundreds of years without any \"western\" model of health care, there are people who are reluctant to seek medical care from a doctor or health assistant trained in the western methods.\n\n[TEXT] Consider a 45 year old grandmother, who resides with her family in the village distant\n\n[TEXT] Funding Opportunity Number: HRSA-26-004 Received Date: 12/3/2025 4:49:01 PM\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 15 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 243095\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: 6 H80CS30720-09-03\n\n[TEXT] from the hospital. When she develops dizziness and a headache, the health problem does not seem sufficiently serious to warrant the long trip to the hospital. The trip involves finding transportation, locating someone to baby-sit the grandchildren she cares for, finding money to pay for gas or a taxi, and perhaps lunch, and probably a long wait at the hospital. Thus, it is not until the woman's symptoms have become more serious (loss of ability to talk from a stroke brought on by severe hypertension for example) that she is brought to the hospital and admitted. One of the core health service performance indicators for the Federated States of Micronesia is the percent of primary care encounters that are delivered outside of the hospital.\n\n[TEXT] · Unemployment, income level, and/or literacy -- Weno is home to 30% of Chuuk State residents and is the primary cross-roads for travel and services for Chuuk's inhabited islands. Residents needing all but the most basic health services (usually provided by a health aide), must typically travel to Weno for services or wait for visiting health professionals arriving by ship, which can mean delays of anywhere from one to three months.\n\n[TEXT] In 2010, the unemployment rate for Chuuk's lagoon islands, which include Weno, was 32% compared to the current rate of 5.5% in the US. (It is important to note that available Chuuk State Data data sources are not commonly broken down by sub-areas\n\n[TEXT] 4\n\n[TEXT] such as Weno.) Ninety seven percent of households engage in some kind of home production activities, such as fishing, agriculture, or livestock, while 16% of residents operate outside of the cash economy altogether, filling their needs for basic food and shelter by subsistence activities.3 Most of these families would dearly like to have someone working for pay but lack the opportunity to do so. Age dependency ratio among residents of Chuuk Lagoon-the ratio of persons in the \"dependent\" age groups (younger than 15 and older than 64) relative to those in the \"economically productive\" age group (15 to 64) is 67. This means that an average of 100 people of working age support 67 total dependents. This is high by international standards (the US dependency ratio in 2010 was 49).4 The high out-migration of the population to Guam, Hawaii and the US mainland in search of jobs is a stark indication of the lack of economic opportunity, draining Chuuk of working aged residents who would otherwise provide a stronger economic base for health systems. Nearly 50% of residents of Chuuk Lagoon islands have immediate family members residing abroad, mostly in the US.\n\n[TEXT] Per capita Gross Domestic Product in Chuuk State was $1,441 in 2013, which is the lowest of the four FSM states and substantially lower than the US ($54,042 in 2013).5 The 2013/14 average annual household income in Chuuk was $11,398, again the lowest of all four FSM States and roughly 23% of the US household income for 2013 (US Census). Average household size in Chuuk Lagoon is 6.6. 95% of family incomes fall below the US Federal Poverty level, and 98% below 200% of the US federal poverty level7. Because of these poor financial circumstances, people are facing the very real truth of choosing to buy food for their family over such 'luxuries' as preventive healthcare. Therefore, the community tends to seek healthcare for acute situations and severe conditions only when they cannot avoid it, leading to poor outcomes and\n\n[TEXT] Funding Opportunity Number: HRSA-26-004 Received Date: 12/3/2025 4:49:01 PM\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 16 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 243095\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: 6 H80CS30720-09-03\n\n[TEXT] expensive off-island specialty care.

By comparison, the high school graduation rate in the US was 80% for the 2011/12 school year. Among the same Chuukese population 5 years or older, 92% are literate (defined as being able to \"read, write and understand a simple sentence in any language\") with 92% being literate in Chuukese and 51% literate in English.

Residents of the FSM, including Chuuk State, are not eligible for US federal programs such as Medicaid, Medicare and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). The US Affordable Care Act does not apply to the FSM. Two medical insurance plans operate in Chuuk state: The FSM National Medical Insurance Plan, referred to as \"MiCare\" and the Chuuk State Health plan.\n\n[TEXT] · MiCare covers a negligible number of Chuuk residents (around 900 or 2% of the population) and pays for mostly off-island care in Hawaii, Guam andManila.8 . The Chuuk State Health Care Plan is an independent health care insurance plan operated by the Chuuk State. It covers 30% of state residents. All working residents are eligible to enroll themselves and up to five dependents. Enrollees receive basic health care from Chuuk State Hospital including: physical examination and wellness advice; prenatal care; family planning; immunization; vision test; hearing test; and dental examinations including x-ray, cleaning and extraction. Subscribers are also eligible for off-island medical referrals to selected providers in the Philippines, as resources permit.º The Chuuk State Health Plan pays for local services through block per capita payments to the hospital rather than \"fee-for-service\" rate and claims structures common in the US\n\n[HEADING] b.

There are numerous indications that poor access to care impairs the health of the population in Chuuk. The life expectancy of under 66 years in Chuuk state is far lower than the US (78 years) and far lower than any one US state. The lack of access to high quality preventive and curative services is surely a factor in this disparity. Like most of Micronesia, Chuuk has experienced an epidemiological transition wherein diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cancers have emerged even as infectious and nutritional deficiency diseases continue to exact a heavy toll. In fact, Chuukese suffers from one of the highest burdens of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in the world. Most deaths (44.3%) highest in the states of FSM (2016 January NCD mortality in FSM) these 44.9% are obese. The leading causes of death in Chuuk are due to metabolic diseases (such as diabetes) and diseases of the circulatory system (such as heart attacks and strokes) as the second leading cause of death. Deaths due to cancer and Diabetes are the top five leading cause of death. As a result, hospitalization rates for diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease are much higher in Chuuk than in the other FSM States (at 48% admissions/ 1000 pop/year) and over 50% of deaths in Chuuk from 2013-10 were caused by NCDs.\n\n[TEXT] 8 MiCare Health Plan Annual Report, FY2013, http://www.micareplan.fm/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Mi-Care Annual-Report-2013.pdf\n\n[TEXT] *Presentation: Health Insurance Coverage for our Communities, 32nd APIL General Assembly, Eric Plinske, June 2013 http://apilpacific.com/files/APIL%20Regional%20Health%20Plan%20Presentation.pdf\n\n[TEXT] 6\n\n[TEXT] Unlike infectious and deficiency diseases, NCDs often require relatively sophisticated means of diagnosis and treatment. They impose an especially large financial burden and tend to tilt the balance of health services toward the provision of secondary and tertiary care. Chuuk State can ill afford these expenses. The effect of the emergence of NCDs in combination with Chuuk's resource limitations has been to exacerbate the disparities in health care and status between Chuuk and communities in the U.S. Better targeting of case finding and outreach to bring cases to treatment at an early stage are needed.\n\n[TEXT] In October 2011, the Governor of Chuuk issued an Executive Order \"declaring a state of health emergency due to the epidemic of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in the Chuuk State and ordering the Director of Health Services to immediately establish programs to stop the epidemic and reduce the risk of factors for non-communicable diseases.\"\n\n[HEADING] c. Health disparities\n\n[TEXT] Together with the low life expectancy, there are a number of other indicators that demonstrate a wide disparity between the health status of the population in Chuuk and that of the U.S. as a whole:\n\n[TEXT] · The infant mortality rate, 20/1000 year10, has risen over the past 5 years and is nearly 3 times that of the U.S (at 6.1/1000/yr).11 Many of these deaths are caused by perinatal conditions that will be ameliorated by better access to prenatal care.\n\n[TEXT] · Communicable diseases associated with developing countries are endemic in Chuuk (multiple drug resistant TB, dengue, leprosy).\n\n[TEXT] · The childhood immunization rate among two year old children in 2011 was only 55%.12 Another report put the Chuuk immunization rate for 2011 at only 27%.13 .\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 18 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 243095\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: 6 H80CS30720-09-03\n\n[TEXT] The prevalence of anemia in pregnancy (13% in 2014)14 is nearly twice that for pregnant low income women in the U.S (29%).15\n\n[TEXT] · Only 28% of pregnancies in the FSM enter prenatal care in the first trimester in 2011, while 48% of women received adequate prenatal care in 2010.16 This is a vivid indication of poor access to prenatal care.

The habit of chewing betel nut has many harmful effects on health. The International Agency for Research on Cancer concluded that chewing betel nut is carcinogenic to humans. Betel nut \"affects almost all organs of the human body, including the brain, heart, lungs, gastrointestinal tract and reproductive organs. It causes or aggravates pre-existing conditions such as neuronal injury, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, hepatotoxicity, asthma, central obesity, type II diabetes, hyperlipidemia, metabolic syndrome, etc. Areca nut affects the endocrine system, leading to hypothyroidism, prostate hyperplasia and infertility. It affects the immune system leading to suppression of T-cell activity and decreased release of cytokines. It has harmful effects on the fetus when used during pregnancy.\"23 Rates of betelnut chewing are very high Chuuk-A 2007 WHO STEPS survey revealed that 22.5% of those aged 25 - 64 years currently chew betelnut, often in combination with tobacco. In Chuuk, 31.8% of men and 13.3% of women chew betelnut, mostly in the age group 25-34. Of males and females combined 22.5% chewed betel in the 12 months before the survey and 12.8% on a daily basis.

Ensuring access to services\n\n[TEXT] Each site of the three sites are staffed by generalists (one full-time general practitioner/physician, a full-time nurse, and two full-time community and behavioral health workers) who provide a broad spectrum of general primary medical care, including reproductive health care, chronic and non- communicable disease monitoring and treatment, developmental screening andservices for children, and health education/promotion activities. Outpatient services at the hospital are limited and focus primarily on secondary health care services in response to patients presenting late for care in the disease cycle, due to transportation, and financial barriers.\n\n[TEXT] Labs in the FSM are not subject to CLIA certification, but all three sites provide basic (\"CLIA waved\") diagnostic laboratory services, such as blood glucose, pregnancy, and cholesterol. For more complex lab tests, specimens are collected at the CCHC sites and transported by CCHC vehicles to the hospital in Nepukos, on an established (daily) schedule. For diagnostic radiology services, CSH employs three x-ray technicians; patients needing transport to the hospital for X rays are shuttled in a CCHC vehicle, which runs several times a day among CHC sites and the hospital.\n\n[TEXT] 26 For a review see: Murray CJ et.al.

Clinicians and community health workers adhere to standard screening protocolsfor each life stage. Community health workers conduct screenings in the homes, community and in the clinic.\n\n[TEXT] On-call services for all three sites are rotated among CCHC providers. Health center sites, phone messages and written materials give instructions to patients for coverage for emergencies during and after hours, including reaching on-call CHC staff and accessing emergency services at the hospital.\n\n[TEXT] Voluntary family planning services are integrated into well-baby, perinatal, and antenatal services provided by clinicians and support staff at each site. In addition, clinicians and community health workers have been trained to provide family planning counseling and contraceptive services during clinic hours.\n\n[TEXT] The CCHC staff provide immunization services at all three sites. Immunizations are included in age-appropriate screening protocols and provided by clinical and paraprofessional staff during clinic hours and, when appropriate, by paraprofessional staff in the community and homes, especially for those individuals, such as children and home-bound patients. Finally, CHC staff participate in seasonal immunization drives led by PH immunization programs.\n\n[TEXT] Funding Opportunity Number: HRSA-26-004 Received Date: 12/3/2025 4:49:01 PM\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 22 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 243095\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: 6 H80CS30720-09-03\n\n[TEXT] CCHC conducts well-child services during half-day clinics at each of the three service sites. In addition, CCHC clinicians and CHWs provide well-child services during regular clinic hours to facilitate the early identification of anemia, vitamin A deficiency, intestinal parasites, obesity and growth delay. Vaccines are available at each health center site.\n\n[TEXT] CHC clinicians provide basic gynecological care during clinic hours. Chuuk State Hospital has two full-time gynecologists on staff who handle more complex cases, by referral and, as necessary, assisted by CCHC transportation services.\n\n[TEXT] CCHC clinicians and paraprofessional staff provide perinatal and post partum on site, in coordination with the CDHS-PH MCH program. Pregnant women identified in the community are also referred by CHC staff to CDHS-PH for MCH service enrollment, while CDHS-PH MCH registries currently assist the CHC with identifying, tracking and providing services for other pregnant women in the community. Chuuk State Hospital clinicians and five full-time nurse midwives provide labor and delivery services at the hospital. CDHS also has two full-time gynecologists-one in public health and one at the hospital-to assist with more complex cases.\n\n[TEXT] CCHC has on staff a full-time CHC dentist and a full-time dental hygienist who rotate weekly among all three sites providing preventive dental care and additional dental services using two portable dental chairs. Portable chairs provide ease of maintenance and allow limited clinic space to be used for other purposes on days when dental staff are servicing one of the two other sites. Complex dental cases are handled by the CHC dentist or referred to the three CDHS dentists currently working at the hospital, depending upon location and staff availability.\n\n[TEXT] 11 The FSM has a significant lack of behavioral health professionals (the entire nation of the FSM has only one full-time psychiatrist who rotates among all four states). Hence mental health/behavioral health and substance abuse services in the region rely significantly on generalists and paraprofessional staff trained to provide basic BH/MH services. Providers at CCHC were trained by World Health Organization's mental health Gap Action Program (mhGAP). mhGAP addresses the lack of care for people suffering from mental, neurological and substance use, through its mhGAP intervention guide and training program designed for general health-care providers who work in nonspecialized health-care settings, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. mhGAP supports general physicians, nurses, midwives and clinical officers, as well as physicians specialized in areas other than psychiatry or neurology. In addition to clinical guidance, the program provides tools to support program implementation useful for situational analysis, adaptations of clinical protocols to local contexts, program planning, training, supervision and monitoring relevant to providing effective BH/MH services. All CHCC's Community Health Workers have also been trained in mhGAP, as well as our full-time School Counselor headquartered at Chuuk High School.\n\n[TEXT] Ninety-nine percent of the population of Chuuk, and nearly all providers and health staff,speak Chuukese and nearly 100% speak English, so there is minimal need for translationservices.

All CCHC physicians have been trained and provide NCD-related nutritional counseling as a standard of care for patients identified with NCDs or NCD risk.\n\n[TEXT] In addition to their clinical duties, CCHC site physicians assist with outreach, in partnership with CCHC community health workers, providing annual school-based health screening that includes anthropometry, vision and hearing screening, screening for emotional problems, tobacco and alcohol use. They link students needing follow up to CCHC and Public Health services, as needed, assisted by CHWs, who help with case management.\n\n[TEXT] CCHC provides transportation services using an oncall CCHC vehicle that travels several times a day among all three CHC sites and the hospital and PH programs. The driver also serves as courier to fill CHC prescriptions at the hospital and for drugs not covered by the CHC site formulary. Taxis are $1 each way and are also available to patients, though still cost prohibitive for many.\n\n[TEXT] Case Management - CHWs deployed through work orders to provide needed follow-up and preventive services to people in their homes. People needing follow-up in the community are\n\n[TEXT] 12\n\n[TEXT] identified by physicians (e.g. post-partum for new mothers and infants or by physicians discharging patients from the ER or hospital wards), public health disease registries and community outreach surveys/screenings. The CCHC Case Manager collaborates with public health NCD and MCH program managers to identify patients from disease registries who need outreach (particular attention is given to chronic disease patients who have missed appointments). The Case Manager generates individual work orders for these patients, which are then routed to the overseeing CCHC clinic physician, who assigns them to the clinic's CHWs. Upon completion of the work order tasks, the CHW returns the work orders to the supervising physician, who routes them back to the CCHC Case Manager, who forwards them on to the NCD and MCH public health programs as needed to update registry information.\n\n[TEXT] During this new project period, we plan expand this approach to other PH programs, including Family Planning, Immunization, Children with Special Needs, Tobacco Control, and Communicable Diseases, such as TB, Leprosy and HIV/AIDS.\n\n[TEXT] Figure 2:\n\n[TEXT] Preventive Health Services\n\n[TEXT] a\n\n[TEXT] Registries to ID at-risk patients\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 24 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 243095\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: 6 H80CS30720-09-03\n\n[TEXT] PH Program Coordinators\n\n[TEXT] Work orders List of Names\n\n[TEXT] Data entry station CCHC Case Mngr\n\n[TEXT] A\n\n[TEXT] Work orders to site Drs\n\n[TEXT] CCHC Case Mngr\n\n[TEXT] A\n\n[TEXT] Work orders to CHWs\n\n[TEXT] a\n\n[TEXT] Site Drs sign off completed Work orders\n\n[TEXT] 13\n\n[HEADING] 2. Service delivery sites\n\n[TEXT] The three CCHC site locations form a triangle of roughly equidistant points on Weno, which minimizes travel time for a vast majority of the target population. Decentralization of a comprehensive array of primary health services, as well as transportation services through a regular van run among all three sites and the hospital, has had a significant impact on service access.\n\n[TEXT] Service Sites - The CCHC has three primary and permanent delivery sites, serving geographical catchment areas that define Chuuk's four municipalities. The sites include: 1. Neou Health Center, on the southern West tip of the island, is housed in a facility owned locally by the William family. Target community: Neou Village (1385 residents), Wichap Village (1,233 residents), Epinup Village (333 residents), Mwan Village (1,417 residents). Total combine population: 4,368. 2. Nepukos Health Center, on the main business thoroughfare and urban center of Weno, the Nepukos site is one mile from the hospital and public health programs, 3/4 miles from the Chuuk High School and the College of Micronesia-FSM, and immediately adjacent to the State's primary landing port for Chuuk residents traveling from neighboring islands, often seeking health services. Target population Chuuk High School (1,200 students); College of Micronesia-FSM (800 students); Nepukos Village (2314 residents), Iras Village\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 25 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 243095\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: 6 H80CS30720-09-03\n\n[TEXT] (2511 residents). The Nepukos site serves as the main administrative offices for the CCHC. 3. Spuk Health Center, on the northern Eastern tip of the island, in a renovated structure provided to CCHC through a private lease (attached). Target community: Sapuk Village (1197 residents), Penia Village (487 residents), Peniesene Village (551 residents) and Tunnuk Village (780 residents). Total combined population: 3,015.\n\n[TEXT] The Neou facility is provided in-kind by the William Family, through MOA. The Nepukos CHC is on the first floor of a government owned building previously occupied by the American Red Cross. It is provided in-kind by Chuuk State. All three sites have roughly similar functional spaces, including exam rooms, consultation rooms, a reception area, space for administrative activities space for medical records, laboratory and pharmaceuticals and reception areas with counters and furniture creating appropriate partitions. Nepukos, Sapuk, and Neou are open forty hours per week, 8am to 5pm, Monday through Friday.\n\n[HEADING] 3. Responding to patient medical emergencies\n\n[TEXT] Chuuk State Hospital has a 24-hour emergency room and one ambulance. The hospital is 90 and 60 minutes from both Sapuk and Neou communities, respectively. All clinical staff are trained in basic life support skills. Signage and messaging at all three health center sites direct patients after hour inquiries for urgent care to on-call CHC staff and Chuuk State Hospital emergency numbers.\n\n[TEXT] 14\n\n[HEADING] 4. Continuity of care\n\n[TEXT] General non-urgent ambulatory medical care is available 40 hours per week at each health center site, on a schedule prescribed by the Board. One CHCC physician is on call at all times after hours, to assist with urgent care. Emergency care is available at Chuuk State Hospital (CSH). Each health center physician currently maintains clinical staff privileges at CSH and follows patients who are admitted to the hospital until discharge. CSH has agreed to take all referrals from CCHC staff. The hospital provides CHCC staff with admission and discharge/followup summaries for all CHCC patients receiving in patient and urgent care. The hospital maintains a secured box where all CHCC-related admission and discharge summaries are deposited on a daily basis. CHCC nursing staff retrieve and distribute the summaries to the appropriate service sites on a daily basis.\n\n[TEXT] Continuity of care, particularly between the hospital and CCHC sites, is provided by a full- time case manager who helps patients navigate between levels of care and who also assists with the transfer of appropriate information-such as lab and radiology results, discharge plans and pertinent medical records-between the CHC sites and CDHS divisions, such as the Hospital and Department of Public Health. Other strategies for ensuring continuity of care include: 1) providing on-call CHCC providers, 24- hours); 2) ensuring that all CCHC physicians have admitting privileges at Chuuk State Hospital; 3) maintaining protocols with the hospital to include timely notification of CCHC physicians, when CCHC patients are admitted and\n\n[TEXT] Funding Opportunity Number: HRSA-26-004 Received Date: 12/3/2025 4:49:01 PM\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 26 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 243095\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: 6 H80CS30720-09-03\n\n[TEXT] discharged from inpatient units or the emergency room; 4) assigning responsibility for discharge planning to a CCHC case manager; 5) developing an effective case management system that ensures that all referrals for primary care and specialty services are logged and tracked for follow through.\n\n[TEXT] 5&6. Sliding fee discount program and how discounts are structured.\n\n[TEXT] The Chuuk State Constitution already guarantees that Chuuk government health services cannot be denied based upon an inability to pay, as per the following:\n\n[TEXT] Article X: Education and Health\n\n[TEXT] Section 6: The State Government shall provide for the protection and promotion of health, and shall ensure, within the limits of its resources, that no person is discriminated against in the distribution of medical care, or is refused medical care because of that person's inability to pay.\n\n[TEXT] Chuuk residents are not asked to contribute payments to their care at the Chuuk Department of Health Services hospital and public health department. It is also important to note that 98% of the population lives below 200% of the US Federal Poverty Level and that a significant percentage of the population lives a subsistence life style, qualifying them for the minimal payments under the sliding fee scale.\n\n[TEXT] A board-approved 2025 sliding fee scale (SFS). The SFS takes into account the following: · The overall absence of a copay culture in Chuuk and the need to build such a culture incrementally.\n\n[TEXT] 15\n\n[TEXT] · The very high poverty level of Chuukese residents\n\n[TEXT] . The need to avoid discouraging residents from using CHC sites. Services at the hospital continue to be provided without charge to patients, while CHC services have a sliding fee structure, creating a potential disincentive for use.\n\n[TEXT] · The convenience of accessing services at CHC community sites, including Sapuk and Neou, where residents would otherwise pay $2 round trip for taxi service to the hospital, and Nepukos, which (though less than a mile from the hospital) is in the center of town and immediately adjacent to Weno's primary harbor for neighbor island travel.\n\n[TEXT] The Sliding Fee Discount Program is provided for all patients based on income and family size only. No patient is denied care based on inability to pay in accordance with Chuuk's State constitution and no patient is discriminated against in the distribution of medical care.\n\n[TEXT] CCHC charges a nominal flat amount to patients at or below 100% of the federal poverty level (FPL). CCHC evaluates this fee at a minimum once every three years to ensure that it is not a barrier to care from the patient's perspective. There are three discount classes for patients above 100% up to 200% of the FPL. Individuals and families with annual income above two hundred percent (200%) of the FPL are not eligible for sliding fee discount program.\n\n[TEXT] CCHC maintains a schedule of fees that is consistent with the locally prevailing rates and\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 27 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 243095\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: 6 H80CS30720-09-03\n\n[TEXT] designed to cover CCHC's reasonable costs of operations (Charge Master). The schedule of fees/charge master is approved by the Board of Directors and updated as needed but at a minimum once every three years. The Federal Poverty Levels are updated annually within a reasonable time of the published annual Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG).\n\n[TEXT] CHC ensures that all patients are informed of the Sliding Fee Discount Program through the combination of one or more of the following methods: 1) staff notify the patients at time of registration and 2) signs in the lobby/waiting areas. All communication with patients are at the patient's literacy level and in their language (English and Chuukese).\n\n[TEXT] As indicated, 98% of the population of Chuuk live below 200% of the US Federal Poverty Level and a significant percent of the population lives a subsistence life style, with unemployment as high as 38%, qualifying them for a nominal fee under CCHC's sliding fee discount program. A self-declaration of income and family size is being used under CCHC\"s sliding fee policy for patients who do not receive a pay stub. Family size is defined as husband, wife, children by blood or adoption and is based on self-declaration. Income is defined as Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) if a patient files a tax return and if no tax return is filed income, is defined as any source of income for which the family receives based on a self-declaration. No further documentation is required for income or family size verification for self-declaration.\n\n[TEXT] The nominal fee is set at $1.00 for patient whose income is 100% or below the Federal Poverty Level. This amount is considered nominal from the patient perspective and does not cover the true cost of the care. CCHC has three sliding fee discount pay classes/categories for individuals and families with income above 100% of the FPL and at or below 200% of the FPL. Income threshold for sliding fee is categories into the following discount classes:\n\n[TEXT] 16\n\n[TEXT] A = 100% or below FPL B=>100%-133% FPL C=>133%-166% FPL D=>166%-200% FPL E=>200% or greater of FPL - No Discount- 100% of Fee Schedule/Charge Master as established by CCHC.\n\n[TEXT] The Executive Director is the only individual allowed to waive fees based on hardship situation that would cause a barrier to care for a patient. Justification for such waiver is documented and signed off by the CEO and a waiver adjustment code will be set up so that these accounts can be\n\n[TEXT] tracked and if necessary used to evaluate the nominal fee amount in the future . All services provided by CCHC and included in the Center's scope of project are covered by the Sliding Fee Discount Program.\n\n[TEXT] Off-Island Care - State payments for off-island tertiary services for uninsured patients are carefully rationed, based upon health needs of uninsured patients rather than income level.

Medical productivity is consistent with HRSA guidelines and UDS reports from Pacific CHC using a comparable service delivery model. During six months of operations, between June and December of 2017, CHCC saw 2,990 patients during 8090 visits. We anticipate no problem meeting our projected user and visit targets.\n\n[HEADING] COLLABORATION\n\n[TEXT] 1. Coordinating and integrating activities with other providers\n\n[TEXT] a. Continuity of care across providers\n\n[TEXT] The Chuuk Department of Health Services provides the only available health services in Chuuk State. There are no other hospitals, private providers, rural health clinics or FQHCs (besides CCHC) in Chuuk State.\n\n[TEXT] The Chuuk Department of Health Services has been operating the health care delivery system since the beginning of the Trust Territory period in the 1950's. CDHS services include: . A 125 bed inpatient unit\n\n[TEXT] · A 24-hour emergency room\n\n[TEXT] · General walk- in outpatient services (focus is more on secondary interventions, given the patient population)\n\n[TEXT] 17\n\n[TEXT] · Obstetric, general surgery, pediatric inpatient services\n\n[TEXT] · Communicable disease isolation\n\n[TEXT] · Public health programs, already listed above.\n\n[TEXT] CDHS operates a variety of public health programs funded through US- and international (WHO) funding sources. CDHS is using the CHC model to decentralize and integrate these programs into the community. Public health programs to be coordinated and/or integrated into CHC service sites include:\n\n[TEXT] · Maternal and Child Health (MCH), including well-baby, postnatal and prenatal and universal new born screening.\n\n[TEXT] · Family Planning Program\n\n[TEXT] · Substance Abuse and Mental Health (SAMHA) which also receives separate funds for Anti-Tobacco activities.\n\n[TEXT] · Environmental health\n\n[TEXT] · Communicable diseases, including TB & Leprosy and HIV/AIDS\n\n[TEXT] · Immunization Program\n\n[TEXT] · Children with Special Needs\n\n[TEXT] · Non-Communicable Disease control, which includes a variety of categorical programs for diabetes and cancer that are increasingly integrated.\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 29 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 243095\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: 6 H80CS30720-09-03\n\n[TEXT] In preparation for our original NAP, CDHS management, along with the PHS Director and Program Coordinators, met for a planning session focused on 1) CHC opportunities and requirements; 2) examples and models of partnership between CHCs and Public Health Programs in the Pacific; and 3) a CHC/PHS integration plan described in the previous \"Response\" section. The plan focuses on:\n\n[TEXT] · Shared/partnered staffing\n\n[TEXT] · Joint training opportunities and transfer of skills\n\n[TEXT] · Service integration, especially for case management, referral and on-site PH specialty clinics\n\n[TEXT] · Joint community assessment, especially in the first year\n\n[TEXT] · Data collection and analysis, including integrating PH registries into CHC case management to identify high risk patient and provide and track in-community service.\n\n[TEXT] As indicated above, we have been only partially successful with the implementation of this plan, having established case management relationships with Public Health MCH and NCD programs in our first project period. In the new project period, we intend to expand this case management relationship with other public health programs with which we currently have referral relationships only. However, we do coordinate annual immunization drives with PH Immunization, which also provides CCHC with all vaccines. Our integration with the hospital has been described in detail above, under Continuity of Care.\n\n[TEXT] b. Access to other necessary community services\n\n[TEXT] CCHC is a new community health center, established in 2016. Our first years have focused on setting up required clinical and enabling services at three new sites. We do provide\n\n[TEXT] 18\n\n[TEXT] transportation and other enabling services (such as outreach) common to CHCs. However, we have not yet developed capacity for integrating with services and supports that typically thought of as \"social determinants of health\". On two occasions in 2018, staff from CCHC made site visits to Kokua Kalihi Valley Comprehensive Family Services (KKV), in Honolulu, Hawaii. KKV has among the most developed SDOH programs in the nation. We intend to integrate SDOH objectives into our strategic plan during the new project period and will continue to explore expanded partnerships for SDOH-related community services.\n\n[TEXT] c. Reduction in non-urgent use of hospital emergency departments\n\n[TEXT] Prior to the establishment of CCHC, all health services were centralized at the hospital in Nepukos. With three new primary care sites equidistantly located throughout the island of Weno, CCHC is having a direct impact on reducing ER visits at the hospital.\n\n[HEADING] 2.

The responsibilities of the QA Manager are detailed in the attached job description and include:\n\n[TEXT] · Ongoing maintenance, review, improvement and implementation of the QA/QI System and Plan at CCHC, including the development of appropriate standards for each CHC site and service; the development and implementation of any new Policies & Procedures applicable to the Public Center ;.\n\n[TEXT] · Evaluation of staff observance and adherence to all policies & procures through QA Audits at every site (including any mobile sites or field services) on a regular basis (at least every 4 months);\n\n[TEXT] · Serving as the Chair of QA Meetings following each site's Audit and follows up with staff to ensure identified deficits are corrected; regular reporting to the Executive Director and the CCHC Board, on the progress, concerns/progress/results of QA Audits and details of actions being taken, or recommended, to correct any deficitsidentified.\n\n[TEXT] · Organization of training programs/workshops to increase professional growth of all staff, and in identifying and evaluating need for new/additional equipment and supplies to improve quality of care;\n\n[TEXT] · Ensuring every staff member has a copy of their current job description, employee handbook and personnel policies and procedures, and all staff Performance Appraisals are performed on time.\n\n[TEXT] 22\n\n[HEADING] 3. How providers conduct QA/QI assessments from patient records\n\n[TEXT] CCHC's commitment to quality care includes the development of an internal system coordinated by the QI Committee to review, evaluate, monitor, and improve the quality and effectiveness of care provided by employed and contracted medical and dental professionals. The QI Committee selects relevant clinical indicators annually, and develops a process to screen patient records for review, response, and corrective-action recommendations for each CCHC clinician. It is the intention that this process is educational and assist providers and the organization with obtaining resources required for high quality patient care.\n\n[TEXT] The QA Manager performs quarterly site audits, using the Quality Assurance Audit Form (attached) that addresses minimum required standards for key areas (Medical Records, Nursing, Doctor's Examination Rooms, Procedures Rooms, and Pharmacy) and procedures for core staff (including detailed procedures for doctors completing and signing all necessary records and forms; pharmacists checking prescriptions carefully and dispensing as instructed; and staff in the procedure rooms practicing sterile and safety techniques at all times).\n\n[HEADING] 4. CCHC's health record system\n\n[TEXT] Like its neighboring health systems in Kosrae and Pohnpei, CDHS does not have electronic\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 34 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 243095\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: 6 H80CS30720-09-03\n\n[TEXT] health records or an automated health information management system (HIMS). FSM national and the state lack the resources and capacity to fund and maintain EHR. Management, clinicians and public health staff depend upon stand-alone, program specific systems, such Web IZ, CDEMS, Cancer Registry, behavioral health (SPF SIG), and the MCH registry database, none of which are inter-connected. It is important to understand that the IT environment in Chuuk is many years behind the US. For example, internet connectivity is sporadic, depending upon limited infrastructure at FSM Telecommunications and an undependable satellite link to Pohnpei; internet services switch on and off unpredictably on most days and when available, are very slow. Dependable and effective data flow depends upon simple and efficient manual systems, assisted by stand-alone programs required by categorical granting programs or developed, home-grown, in MS Access or Excel. The approach to case management described in the RESPONSE section-with physical work orders migrating between public health and CHC staff-is an example of an effective, mostly-manual approach to data systems successfully used at other sites, such as Yap State's Wa'ab Community Health Center. It is important to note that a significant impact on community health can be achieved with simple, mostly-manual systems that support the provision of low-cost primary and preventive services.\n\n[TEXT] Given the size of the population, the severely limited financial resources, the dearth of IT expertise on-island, and the high cost and logistical challenges of automated systems acquisition and maintenance in a remote, sea salt-saturated environment, we do not anticipate having a networked and automated EHR or HIMS anytime soon.\n\n[HEADING] 5.

Financial performance measures (see measures)\n\n[TEXT] See attached form Clinical Performance Measures.\n\n[TEXT] RESOURCES AND CAPABILITIES\n\n[HEADING] 1. Appropriateness of organizationalstructure\n\n[TEXT] CCHC is a public center operating under a co-applicant agreement between the CCHC Governing Board and the Chuuk Department of Health Services. An organizational chart identifying lines of authority and management structure is included in the attachments. Aside from the co-applicant agreement, there are no contracts or subrecipient agreements for services: All services are provided directly by staff employed by CDHS, under the auspices of Chuuk state. The CDHS/CCHC Board co-applicant agreement is typical in every way of a public center and fully compliant with HRSA PIN 14-01 Health Center Program Governance, as described in detail in the GOVERNANCE subsection of this Project Narrative.\n\n[TEXT] The Executive Director reports to the CCHC Governing Board, which has the authority to approve the selection, performance, evaluation, retention, and dismissal of the Executive Director.

Staffing plan\n\n[TEXT] All the three sites are staffed year-round with 1.0 FTE general practice physician/site supervisor; 1.0 FTE nurse; 2.0 FTE community and behavioral health outreach workers; and a 1.0 FTE receptionist/cashier/medical records clerk. Serving all three sites and included in the budget is 1.0 FTE dentist, 1.0 FTE dental hygienist, 1.0 FTE driver/courier, and 1.0 FTE quality assurance manager. All staff, including the executive director, are employees of CCHC/CDHS.\n\n[TEXT] Per HRSA Health Center Compliance Manual 2017 the Board of Directors of CCHC holds the ultimate approval authority for credentialing and privileging all employed and contracted health care providers. The QI Committee implements CCHC's system that investigates and considers each application for initial appointment, temporary privileges, and every-two-year reappointment of its health care providers, according to CCHC's Credentialing and Privileging of Medical and Dental Staff Policy). Physicians and nurses complete their respective Clinical Privileging Forms, which identifies the list of approved clinical privileges for each clinical staff. The completed form is reviewed and approved by the CCHC Executive and MedicalDirectors.\n\n[HEADING] 3. Management Team\n\n[TEXT] The CCHC Executive Director oversees a management team consisting of the Physician Site Supervisors of Sapuk, Neou and Nepukos, the Clinical Director, the Finance Officer, and the QA Manager. The Executive Director has full supervisory responsibility for all staff whose FTEs are funded entirely by the CHC. The position descriptions and biosketches for the following positions are included in the attachments:\n\n[TEXT] · Executive Director\n\n[TEXT] · Medical/Clinical Director\n\n[TEXT] · Operations Manager\n\n[TEXT] · QA Manager\n\n[TEXT] · CHC Finance Officer\n\n[TEXT] 24\n\n[HEADING] 4. Maintaining oversite of contracts and subawards\n\n[TEXT] CCHC/CDHS has no contracts or subrecipient agreements for services. CDHS provides inpatient and some public health services, as described in the attached MOA.\n\n[HEADING] 5. Financial accounting and internal controls\n\n[TEXT] The Chuuk State Government is fully compliant with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and has policies and procedures for financial management typical of government agencies and ensuring standard separation of duties. CCHC employs a full time Finance Officer. The Finance Officer participates in CHC-related financial management training and technical assistance periodically offered through the Pacific Islands Primary Care Association, the National Association of Community Health Centers and HRSA. The CHC Finance Officer provides financial reports monthly and as needed to the Executive Director and CCHC Governing Board.\n\n[TEXT] Funding Opportunity Number: HRSA-26-004 Received Date: 12/3/2025 4:49:01 PM\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 36 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 243095\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: 6 H80CS30720-09-03\n\n[TEXT] CCHC receives the only US Federal Grant in Chuuk State that is not awarded through the national government of the FSM and subsequently passed on to the FSM states. For this reason, Chuuk State Department of Administration recently agreed to allow CCHC to establish its own accounts and related finance and billing policies and procedures, which were developed and implemented with the assistance of a HRSA TA consultant in early 2018.\n\n[TEXT] Based upon HRSA PIN 2014-01, public centers meet CHC audit requirements through their standard government annual financial auditing processes and do not require a separate audit. CDHS and CCHC fall under the auspices of the Chuuk State, which undergoes an annual, independent financial audit. As part of this State audit, CDHS has agreed to facilitate a program audit specific to CCHC, which will address compliance with terms and conditions of the 330 CHC award and Federal Cost Principles.\n\n[HEADING] 6. Billing and collections\n\n[TEXT] The only insurance payments received by CDHS are small annual block payments of less than $100,000 made by MiCare capitated payments. The only fees collected are patient fees based on our sliding fee scale and received by the receptionists/medical records clerk at each site. CCHC finance policies address the administration of these funds. CHC-related fees are budgeted for CHC patient pharmaceuticals and not reallocated to the Chuuk State general fund, which is a common practice.\n\n[HEADING] 7. Use and plan for telehealth\n\n[TEXT] CCHC accesses telehealth provided through two Hawaii-based hospitals:\n\n[TEXT] 25\n\n[TEXT] . The Tripler Army Medical Center, Pacific Island Health Care Project, which we use primarily for complex cardiovascular conditions.\n\n[TEXT] · Shriners Hospital for Children, which we use for complex orthopedic conditions.\n\n[TEXT] In both cases, our providers request and participate telehealth consultations as needed.\n\n[TEXT] In addition, we are currently planning to participate in the Migrant Clinicians Network, a US based nonprofit that specializes in cross-border case management and service coordination for migrating patients. There is considerable migration between Chuuk and Hawaii, with patients traveling between these sites with limited medical information exchange or understanding (on the part of Hawaii providers) of the health infrastructure that is available to support patients returning to Chuuk. To this end, we are also establishing consultation protocols with a Hawaii based community health center (Kokua Kalihi Valley Comprehensive Family Services) that serves the largest number of Chuukese in Hawaii. Representatives from both entities met in Hawaii in September 2018, agreed on the importance of establishing consultation protocols for migrating patients, and recently participated in a planning call with the Migrants Clinicians Network. The Migrants Clinicians Network negotiates trans-border agreements among providers, establishes protocols for services and information exchange, and assists with case management.\n\n[TEXT] 8.

Plan for participating in health center program-related benefits\n\n[TEXT] Chuuk State and residents do not participate in US health insurance programs, such as Medicaid, Medicare, SCHIP or the ACA Marketplaces. Residents of Chuuk, by both the FSM Constitution and Chuuk State Constitution are entitled to basic health services without regard to inability to pay. Thirty percent of Chuuk's population are enrolled in the Chuuk State Health Care Plan (CSHCP) and another 2% are enrolled in MiCare, the FSM national insurance program. Enrollment in CSHCP and MiCare of all low-income populations in Chuuk would be cost prohibitive and would effectively bankrupt the local health system.\n\n[TEXT] CCHC is not eligible for FTCA; Chuuk State is self-insured for purposes of malpractice liability. CCHC does not participate in NHSC: The annual required salary for an NHSC practitioner is prohibitively high for Chuuk salary standards; CCHC can hire local and foreign physicians at a fraction of the cost. Neither does CCHC participate in 340B; our pharmaceutical suppliers provide drugs at costs below the 340B program, which is relevant more to the States and Territories.\n\n[HEADING] GOVERNANCE\n\n[TEXT] CCHC is governed as a public center operating under a co-applicant structure between a community-based board of directors and the Chuuk Department of Health Services. The co applicant agreement, reviewed by the Board and CDHS and signed by the CDHS Director of\n\n[HEADING] 26\n\n[TEXT] Health Services and CCHC Board Chair, identifies the respective domains of Board, CDHS and joint responsibility for governance, in full compliance with HRSA PIN 2014-01 Health Center Program Governance, as it applies to public centers.\n\n[TEXT] The CCHC Governing Board is nonprofit corporation registered with the National Registrar of Corporations, Department of Justice, Federated States of Micronesia. The by-laws were originally drafted using samples from other public CHCs in the Pacific and HRSA PIN 2014-01 and reviewed and approved by the Board. They fully and explicitly comply with HRSA requirements (monthly meetings, written minutes for all board and subcommittee meetings, and the roster of responsibilities delineated in HRSA PIN 2014-01 and included in the bylaws and the coapplicant agreement, including approving the selection and dismissal of the Executive Director. The Board meets monthly and approves the annual budget of CCHC.\n\n[TEXT] Board composition and bylaws comply fully with HRSA governance requirements for composition (9 to 25 board members; user majority; representation from the communities served; an array of relevant expertise; restrictions on health industry remuneration among members; and restrictions on nepotism).

The limitations of government insurance programs. The resources of the two insurance programs available in Chuuk (FSM MiCare and the Chuuk State Health Plan) are devoted almost entirely to off-island referrals for tertiary care, with minimal annual block payments for local care. MiCare made only scant $54,000 in claims payments to Chuuk State Hospital for care to its enrollees, plus a $72,000 annual capitation payment, in 2013.27 Chuuk State Health Plan made $806,000 in claims payments in 2012, mostly covering off-island health care. 28 The entire annual budget for the Chuuk State Department of Health Services, which includes the hospital, was $8,690,951 million in FY2016.\n\n[TEXT] · The absence of private medical insurance. Chuuk State citizens do not have access to private health insurance.\n\n[TEXT] 27 MiCare Health Plan Annual Report, FY2013, http://www.micareplan.fm/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Mi-Care Annual-Report-2013.pdf\n\n[TEXT] Presentation: Health Insurance Coverage for our Communities, 32nd APIL General Assembly, Eric Plinske, June 2013 http://apilpacific.com/files/APIL%20Regional%20Health%20Plan%20Presentation.pdf\n\n[TEXT] 28\n\n[TEXT] · The subsistence and poverty economy, which makes patient fees a significant barrier to care but which provides opportunities for individuals. Only 46.2% of Chuukese residents participate in the labor force.29\n\n[TEXT] · The high cost of travel, for a remote island one time zone and 11 hours from Honolulu and twenty two hours from Washington DC. Without a travel budget, staff will not receive the training and support they need to succeed. For patients, Chuuk State pays for health care and travel to off- island tertiary centers in the Philippines, Guam and Honolulu and this further affects the health care resources available within Chuuk.\n\n[TEXT] · The relatively small budget available for health care in FSM: $415 per capita per year versus $9,403 per capita in the US.30\n\n[TEXT] · The low pay scales, which are typically one third or less of US norms.\n\n[TEXT] These divergences from the US environment have a way of balancing out: Compared to the US, Chuuk State has severely limited opportunities to leverage conventional revenue streams and contributions from government, charities, communities and users. However, staff can be seen as providing a kind of in-kind assistance: Since salaries are one third or less of equivalent salaries offered in the US, and since fringe and tax are also substantially lower in Chuuk State, the proposed personnel would cost at least two to three times more in an equivalent US community health center. For instance, the executive director and medical director each earn about $50,000 per year, while most other staff earn considerably less than\n\n[TEXT] Funding Opportunity Number: HRSA-26-004 Received Date: 12/3/2025 4:49:01 PM\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 40 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 243095\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: 6 H80CS30720-09-03\n\n[TEXT] $20,000 per year. These are considered very competitive salaries in Chuuk State. Hence CCHC may rely more heavily on grant dollars, in terms of cash revenue, but CCHC provides an unparalleled amount of services per grant dollar, due primarily to the lower salaries. In terms of encounters and users served, CCHC is competitive.\n\n[TEXT] Plans for mitigating the adverse impact of financial or workforce related challenges - CCHC depends almost entirely for its budget on the 330 CHC grant. We do not anticipate any challenges with this critical funding source in the near future. We do not receive insurance payments from US Medicare or Medicaid, FSM MiCare, or the Chuuk State Health Plan (as explained in detail above). We have had consistent staffing, have lost only one CHW and one provider in our two years of operations (both have been replaced), and do not anticipate any further departures.\n\n[TEXT] 29 \"Summary Analysis of Key Indicators from FSM 2010 Census of Population Housing\", FSM Office of Statistics, Budget, Overseas Development Assistance and Compact Management. 30 World Bank 2011-15\n\n[TEXT] 29\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 41 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 243095\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: 6 H80CS30720-09-03\n\n[TEXT] Skip to Main Content\n\n[TEXT] SF-424A: BUDGET INFORMATION - Non-Construction Programs\n\n[TEXT] OMB Approval No. 4040-0004 Expiration Date 8/31/2016\n\n[TEXT] SECTION A - BUDGET SUMMARY\n\n[TEXT] Grant Program Function or Activity\n\n[TEXT] Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Number\n\n[TEXT] Estimated Unobligated Funds\n\n[TEXT] New or Revised Budget\n\n[TEXT] Federal\n\n[TEXT] Non-Federal\n\n[TEXT] Federal\n\n[TEXT] Non- Federal\n\n[TEXT] Total\n\n[TEXT] Community Health Center\n\n[TEXT] 93.224\n\n[TEXT] $0.00\n\n[TEXT] $0.00\n\n[TEXT] $650,000.00\n\n[TEXT] $36,250.00\n\n[TEXT] $686,250.00\n\n[TEXT] Total\n\n[TEXT] $0.00\n\n[TEXT] $0.00\n\n[TEXT] $650,000.00\n\n[TEXT] $36,250.00\n\n[TEXT] $686,250.00\n\n[TEXT] SECTION B - BUDGET CATEGORIES\n\n[TEXT] Object Class Categories\n\n[TEXT] Federal\n\n[TEXT] Non-Federal\n\n[TEXT] Total\n\n[TEXT] a.

No patient is denied care based on inability to pay in accordance with Chuuk's State constitution and no patient is discriminated against in the distribution of medical care.\n\n[TEXT] A nominal flat amount will be charged for patients with at or below 100% of the federal poverty level (FPL). The nominal fee will be evaluated at a minimum once every third year or sooner if determined necessary ensure it is not a barrier to care from the patients prospective. There will be three discount classes for patients above 100% up to 200% of the FPL. Individuals and families with annual income above two hundred percent (200%) of the FPL are not eligible for sliding fee discount program.\n\n[TEXT] A schedule of fees will be maintained that is consistent with the CCHC's locally prevailing rates and designed to cover CCHC's reasonable costs of operations (Charge Master). The schedule of fees/charge master will be approved by the Board of Directors and updated as needed but at a minimum once every three years.\n\n[TEXT] Collections of payments for services will be made through reasonable effort and CCHC will establish systems for billing and collections with respect to third party payors once such systems are available in Chuuk.\n\n[TEXT] The Federal Poverty Levels will be updated annually within a reasonable time of the published annual Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG). CHC's Sliding Fee Discount Program P & P will be approved by the board of directors and staff will be trained on the approved policy.\n\n[HEADING] Procedure:\n\n[HEADING] 1. Sliding Fee Discount Notification\n\n[TEXT] 1.1 CHC will ensure all patients are informed of their Sliding Fee Discount Program through the combination of one or more of the following methods:\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 83 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: 6 H80CS30720-09-03\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 243095\n\n[TEXT] a) staff notify the patients at time of registration b) signs in the lobby/waiting areas (see Exhibit \"A \"below) at each site.\n\n[TEXT] 1.2 All communication with patients will be in the patient's literacy level and language (English and Chuukese).\n\n[TEXT] 1.3 All communication with patients will be done in a culturally sensitive manner and will be delivered in a respectful and confidential way. All patients will be treated equally and the sliding fee discount program will be uniformly applied to all patients.\n\n[HEADING] 2. Family and Income (Eligibility)\n\n[TEXT] 2.1 98% of the population of Chuuk live below 200% of the US Federal Poverty Level and a significant percent of the population lives a subsistence life style and a as high 38% unemployment, qualifying them for a nominal fee under CCHC's sliding fee discount program. A self-declaration of income and family size is being used under CCHC\"s sliding fee policy for patients who do not receive a pay stub.\n\n[TEXT] 2.2 Family size will therefore be defined as husband, wife, children by blood or adoption and is based on self-declaration.\n\n[TEXT] 2.3 Income is defined as Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) if a patient files a tax return and if no tax return is filed income is defined as any source of income for which the family receives based on a self-declaration.\n\n[TEXT] 2.4 No further documentation is required for income or family size verification for self- declaration.\n\n[HEADING] 3. Eligibility Period\n\n[TEXT] 3.1 CCHC's eligibility period will be for a 12 month period or if there is any major change to the family size or income. The patient will be required to inform CCHC's staff of any changes if they occur before the 12 month period.\n\n[HEADING] 4. Nominal Fee\n\n[TEXT] 4.1 The nominal fee will be set at $1.00 for patient whose income is 100% or below the Federal Poverty Level. This amount is considered nominal from the patient prospective and does not cover the true cost of the care.\n\n[HEADING] 5. Sliding Scale\n\n[TEXT] 5.1 CCHC has three sliding fee discount pay classes/categories for individuals and families with income above 100% of the FPL and at or below 200% of the FPL. Income threshold for sliding fee is categories into the following discount classes.\n\n[TEXT] Categories/Discount Classes:\n\n[TEXT] A = 100% or below FPL\n\n[TEXT] B = >100% -133% FPL\n\n[TEXT] C = >133%-166% FPL\n\n[TEXT] D = >166%-200% FPL\n\n[TEXT] E = >200% or greater of FPL - No Discount- 100% of Fee Schedule/Charge Master as established by CCHC.\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 84 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 243095\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: 6 H80CS30720-09-03\n\n[TEXT] 5.2 Under CCHC's current SFDP, the nominal amount for the patient in category A would not pay more than the fee paid by a patient in the first SFDS class above the 100% of the FPG.\n\n[HEADING] 6. Waiver of fees\n\n[TEXT] 6.1 CCHC will ensure that no patient is denied care base on ability to pay and accordingly the waiver of fees will occur on a case by case basis.\n\n[TEXT] 6.2 The CEO will be the only one allowed to waive fees based on hardship situation which would cause a barrier to care for a patient. Justification for such waiver will be document and signed off by the CEO and an waiver adjustment code will be set up so that these accounts can be tracked and if necessary used to evaluate the nominal fee amount in the future.\n\n[HEADING] 7. Covered Services\n\n[TEXT] 7.1 All services provided by CCHC and included in the Center's scope of project are covered as part of the Sliding Fee Discount Program (in accordance with Form 5a).\n\n[HEADING] 8. Charge Master/Fee Schedule and Billing Reimbursement\n\n[TEXT] 8.1 Chuuk residents are not asked to contribute payments to their care at the Chuuk Department of Health Services, including the hospital and there are no other health care providers in Chuuk besides the hospital or the CCHC. Accordingly, the prevailing rates for CCHC are zero and patients are unaccustomed to contribute funds to one's own health care. CCHC has had to develop a fee schedule/charge master that is closer to the prevailing rates of zero than their cost to be culturally sensitive and evaluate the impact of this policy.\n\n[TEXT] 8.2 The Fee Schedule/Charge Master is currently as follows:\n\n[TEXT] Service\n\n[TEXT] Charge Master\n\n[TEXT] Office Visits (Medical/Dental/BH)\n\n[TEXT] $5.00\n\n[TEXT] 8.2 CCHC will only charge for one medical encounter (face to face with licensed medical provider), one dental encounter (face to face with licensed dental provider) and mental health encounter (face to face with certified or licensed mental health care professional) at the establish scheduled fee.\n\n[TEXT] 8.3 For reimbursement and billing purposes, multiple medical encounters within the CCHC, which take place on the same day at a single location, constitute a single visit.\n\n[TEXT] 8.4 Mental health care services that are integrated in the delivery of medical care shall be deemed a medical encounter and constitute a single visit.\n\n[TEXT] 8.5 Multiple dental encounters with more than one dental practitioner in the CCHC or with the same dental practitioner, which take place on the same day at a single location, constitutes a single visit.\n\n[TEXT] 8.6 CCHC may bill for one medical encounter, one dental encounter and one mental health encounter per patient per day\n\n[TABLE] Table 15:\nService | Charge Master\nOffice Visits (Medical/Dental/BH) | $5.00\n\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 85 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 243095\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: 6 H80CS30720-09-03\n\n[TEXT] 8.7 The fee schedule/charge master as outlined above is adopted by the CCHC's Board of Directors as part of the approval of this policy. The fee schedule/charge master will be evaluated and updated as needed but at a minimum once every three years.\n\n[HEADING] 9. Referrals\n\n[TEXT] 9.1 Referral services and sliding fee is not an issue for CCHC since as a co-applicant with the government of Chuuk, all services are provided by a single health care system under the Chuuk State government (Chuuk State Department of Health Services(CDHS) which also operate the Chuuk State Hospital). CCHC has an memorandum of agreement with CDHS for all referral services including inpatient, ER, diagnosis services and public health services not performed by CCHC which requires CDHS to see all patients regardless of ability to pay.

Refusal to pay\n\n[TEXT] 10.1 CCHC has decided to not have a 'Refusal to pay\" policy, since this is not a HRSA requirement and would is not culturally acceptable.\n\n[HEADING] 11. Evaluation of SFDP & Nominal fee & Federal Poverty Guideline update\n\n[TEXT] 11.1 The nominal (fee/recipient copayment) is a fixed amount and does not reflect the true cost of the services provided and has been determined by CCHC to be considered nominal from the patient's perspective. CCHC's Board of Directors agree and will evaluate the nominal amount from the patient prospective by one or more of the following methods at a minimum once every three years or sooner if a need is determined:\n\n[TEXT] a) Patient Feedback/survives\n\n[TEXT] b) Staff feed/collection rates/# of waiver of charges approved by CEO\n\n[TEXT] c) Establishing a subcommittee of consumer board to discuss/assess.\n\n[TEXT] d) Other factors such as economic conditions impacting the population of Chuuk at large, legislative changes, etc.\n\n[HEADING] 12. Collections\n\n[TEXT] 12.1 Payment of the nominal (fee/recipient copayment) will be collected at the time of the service.\n\n[TEXT] 12.2 CCHC will maintain uniform payment terms for all patients and all patients will be treated with respect and in a confidential manner and no patient will be denied service based on inability to pay.\n\n[TEXT] 12.3 Payment terms, if needed, will be set up with the patient using the Payment Plan Agreement Form. The form will be sign by the patient and by a CCHC Administration staff for outstanding balances less than $10.00. For amounts greater than the $10,00 payment terms will be approved by the Operations Manager on a case by case basis and be consistent. No patient is refused care due inability to pay.\n\n[TEXT] 13.
