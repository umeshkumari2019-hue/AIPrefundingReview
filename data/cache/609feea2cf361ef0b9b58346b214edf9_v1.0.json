It states: 'Swope Health conducts an annual service area analysis based on patients' zip codes of residence as listed in the most recent UDS.'

The needs assessment is described as ongoing and is updated with the most recent data, including UDS data through 2024, Census estimates through 2022, and community surveys. The narrative specifically states: 'Swope Health's prior Service Area Competition was submitted in October 2022... Since the submission of the FY23 SAC, Swope Health has opened four additional clinics and expanded its geographic service area.' The application details changes in population, health status, and service utilization since the last SAC, and describes how the needs assessment informs service delivery and strategic planning. The process includes annual review and analysis, and the use of the most recent data available for both the general and special populations (e.g., homeless).",
