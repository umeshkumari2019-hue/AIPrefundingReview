The needs assessment is reviewed by key management and the Board. The application includes extensive, recent data throughout the Needs Assessment section (e.g., population, poverty, health outcomes, HPSA/MUA status, chronic disease, social determinants, etc.), with sources cited as recent as 2025. The application also describes annual reviews of the service area and UDS data, and integration of community input.",

          "reasoning": "The application clearly documents that a comprehensive needs assessment was completed in 2025 (within the required three-year window), and that it uses the most recent data available for the service area and target populations. The assessment is used to inform and improve service delivery, as evidenced by its integration into strategic planning, service area review, and Board/management decision-making. The process includes both quantitative and qualitative data, and incorporates community and patient input. There is no evidence of a gap in the three-year requirement or failure to use recent data.
