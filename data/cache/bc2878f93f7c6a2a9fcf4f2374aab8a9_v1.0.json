          "evidence": "1. In the Project Narrative, the applicant states: 'The Rosa Clark Health Center Board of Directors reviews patient usage of services according to the boundaries of the target area quarterly as part of our Quality Assurance quarterly report to determine if any changes are needed. An annual review of the size of the area, the extent to which the boundaries conform to the area served by Federal and State health and social service programs, and the extent to which the boundaries are eliminate barriers to access to care. The identification of the medically underserved population in the area is also reviewed annually.'\n2. In Attachment 13: Health Center Program Requirements Compliance, it states: 'Every three years, for strategic planning purposes, an external environment scan is conducted that addresses: 1) available health resources, ratios of primary care, internal medicine, pediatric and obstetrics and gynecology physicians; 2) health indices such as infant mortality rate, 3) economic factors affecting the population's access to health services, such as the percentage of the population with incomes below the poverty level, and; 4) demographic factors affecting the population's need and demand for health services, such as percentage of the population age 65 and over.'\n3. The Project Narrative and data tables reference use of UDS data from 2021-2024 and cite changes in patient demographics and needs over the past three years, including increases in children, seniors, Hispanic/Latino patients, and those best served in a language other than English.\n4. The application describes how the needs assessment informs service delivery, including plans to hire a nutritionist in response to rising chronic disease, and expansion of sites to address geographic barriers.",

The assessment is used to inform service delivery, as evidenced by plans to expand services and sites in response to identified needs.
