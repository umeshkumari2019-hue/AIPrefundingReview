The co-applicant agreement also addresses the unique public agency context, confirming that only certain government functions (e.g., fiscal and personnel policies) are retained by the public agency as allowed by HRSA policy. There is no evidence of any restriction or infringement on the board’s required authorities. Therefore, the health center is COMPLIANT with this element.",
