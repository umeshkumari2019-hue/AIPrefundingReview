          "evidence": "The application contains a detailed Needs Assessment section that states: 'Baywell Health will conduct a comprehensive community needs assessment every three years, consistent with HRSA SAC and Board policy, integrating data from UDS Mapper, Alameda County Public Health, and regional CHNAs. Interim annual updates will capture demographic and epidemiologic trends, informing revisions to the Scope of Project and operational planning.' The narrative further details use of the most recent UDS Mapper data (2022, as the latest available), county public health reports, and partner hospital CHNAs. The assessment addresses population demographics, health disparities, social determinants, and service area trends. It also describes annual reviews and Board presentations of findings, and links the assessment to service planning and resource allocation. The application includes specific data points, tables, and projections based on recent data (2022-2025), and describes ongoing community input and annual interim updates.",

The needs assessment uses the most recently available data (explicitly noting the use of 2022 UDS Mapper data as the latest available), incorporates county and local data, and addresses all required elements (demographics, health disparities, social determinants, service area trends, and special populations such as the Black community and homeless individuals). The process is clearly described as informing service delivery, resource allocation, and Board decision-making. There is no evidence of a gap in the three-year cycle, and the assessment is current and robust. Therefore, this element is COMPLIANT.",
