The needs assessment utilizes the most recently available data for the service area and, if applicable, special populations and addresses the following:",
          "evidence": "1. The Project Narrative, under 'Patient and Needs Assessment', states: 'Every three years, New River Health Association, Inc. completes a comprehensive needs assessment. It is a quantitative document that provides comparison data of the three-county service area, West Virginia, and the United States. It includes diagnosis-specific information as well as socioeconomic factors such as income, poverty levels, education levels, transportation availability, food accessibility, recreation and activity availability. Community, patient, and employee survey responses are used to inform decisions made regarding service delivery sites and services offered.'\n2. The Bylaws, Article VIII, Section 8.7.a, require the Strategic Planning/Community Health Committee to 'conduct or collaborate with other organizations to conduct a community needs assessment every three (3) years.'\n3. The narrative references use of 'the most recent UDS data' and '2023 population estimate' as well as 2024 and 2025 data throughout the needs assessment section.\n4. The needs assessment is described as informing service delivery, site selection, and program modifications (e.g., expansion of School Based Health Centers, transportation services, call center staffing, etc.).\n5. The application includes recent data (2023, 2024, 2025) on population, poverty, health outcomes, and other relevant indicators for the service area.\n6. The application describes annual reviews and the use of multiple data sources (UDS, census, CDC, patient surveys, etc.) to inform ongoing needs assessment and service adjustments.",

          "reasoning": "The application provides clear and specific evidence that a comprehensive needs assessment is conducted and updated at least every three years, as required. The process is codified in the Bylaws and described in the Project Narrative. The needs assessment uses the most recent available data, covers the required topics (demographics, health status, social determinants, barriers to care, etc.), and is used to inform and improve service delivery. The inclusion of recent data and examples of how the needs assessment has led to program changes (e.g., transportation, school-based clinics, call center improvements) further supports compliance. There is no indication of any gap in the three-year cycle or lack of use of current data.",
