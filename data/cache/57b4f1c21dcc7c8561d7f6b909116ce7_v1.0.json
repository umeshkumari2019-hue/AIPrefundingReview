The narrative references use of the most recent available data, including 2023 MDHHS Health Risk Behaviors Report, 2025 County Comparison data, and 2024 UDS results. 4. The needs assessment covers the entire service area (Allegan, Berrien, Ottawa, Van Buren counties) and includes special populations such as farmworkers, with specific data and outreach strategies described. 5. The needs assessment is explicitly linked to action, with examples of program changes and expansions resulting from the findings. 6. The application provides data tables and references to external sources (e.g., County Health Rankings, BRFSS, CHNAs) and includes annual review and update language. 7. The application narrative repeatedly states that the needs assessment is updated annually and that the Board reviews and approves updates at least every three years (see Bylaws, Article III, Section 13A(5), and Project Narrative Section 1.4). 8.
