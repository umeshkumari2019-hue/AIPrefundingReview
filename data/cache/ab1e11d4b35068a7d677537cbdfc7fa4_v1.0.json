The needs assessment utilizes the most recently available data for the service area and, if applicable, special populations and addresses the following:",

The needs assessment utilizes the most recently available data for the service area and, if applicable, special populations and addresses the following:",
          "evidence": "In the Project Narrative, under '5. Describe how you will: a) Conduct and update your needs assessment,' the application states: 'NSCH engages in a needs assessment annually and presents the results to its Board. Staff utilize the following sources for data: NSCH's annual patient satisfaction survey; UDS from the prior year; local hospitals' needs assessments; and any/all community health data available. Staff assess the data to determine any/all unmet needs and make appropriate recommendations to the Board of Directors.' The narrative also describes a Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) process funded in 2024, which includes building a Community Advisory Council to collect and analyze data. The application further describes the use of UDS data, local/state data, and community needs assessments from hospitals (every two years), and states that the needs assessment is reviewed annually. The application includes recent data trends (2020-2024) and describes how needs assessment findings inform service delivery and resource allocation (e.g., hiring a part-time pediatrician in response to increased pediatric need).",

          "reasoning": "The application provides clear evidence that the health center completes or updates a needs assessment at least annually, which exceeds the minimum HRSA requirement of once every three years. The needs assessment uses the most recent available data (UDS, local/state, hospital data, patient surveys), covers the current population and service area, and is used to inform and improve service delivery (e.g., hiring decisions, program expansion). The CHIP process further demonstrates a structured approach to community input and data analysis. Therefore, the application is COMPLIANT with Element b - Update of Needs Assessment.",
