(ACH), formerly known as Wake Health Services, is a private, nonprofit, Health Center Program (HCP) grantee funded under Section 330(e) as a Community Health Center and Section 330(h) as a Health Care for the Homeless (HCH) Program. ACH proudly serves Wake and Franklin Counties, North Carolina, operating twelve permanent service delivery sites, one administrative/service delivery site, one mobile unit, and one administrative office to maximize access across the service area.\n\n[TEXT] Since its founding more than 50-years ago, ACH has remained steadfast in its mission to meet the health care needs of its communities and has become a trusted and vital patient-centered medical home throughout the region.\n\n[TEXT] MISSION To deliver quality, compassionate primary health care - every patient, every time - in response to the needs of our communities.\n\n[TEXT] VISION We are a model of affordable health care and a trusted partner, building healthy communities, one patient at a time.\n\n[TEXT] ACH fulfills this mission with the highest ethical standards and unwavering commitment to equitable access - regardless of ability to pay, insurance status, or income. ACH is dedicated to providing patient-centered, accessible, cost-effective, and timely primary health care for all, recognizing that access to quality medical care is essential to the overall health of the community.\n\n[TEXT] The purpose of ACH is to provide comprehensive, coordinated, and community-responsive primary health care services by:\n\n[TEXT] · Assisting residents in accessing medical, dental, behavioral health, and pharmaceutical care through individualized education and advocacy;\n\n[TEXT] · Helping patients develop personal health care plans while facilitating coordination among all providers and services in the community; and\n\n[TEXT] · Reducing the economic burden of care for low-income, underserved, and uninsured residents.\n\n[TEXT] ACH serves as a vital access point for medically underserved residents across the service area. The organization's care delivery model is built on reducing health disparities, increasing access to essential services, and eliminating barriers to comprehensive care. ACH's family- and community-oriented approach ensures the delivery of integrated services across all stages of life - from pediatrics to geriatrics - promoting continuity of care, patient trust, and improved long-term outcomes.\n\n[TEXT] ACH ensures that all required services are available to patients either directly or through formal referral arrangements. These services include General Primary Care, Diagnostic Laboratory, Diagnostic Radiology, Screenings, Coverage for Emergencies During and After Hours, Voluntary Family Planning, Immunizations, Well Child Services, Gynecological Care, Obstetrical - Prenatal, Intrapartum, and Postpartum, Dental - Preventive, Pharmaceutical Services, Health Care for the Homeless (HCH) Required Substance Use\n\n[TEXT] Advance Community Health, Inc.

These include Additional Dental Services, Mental Health Services, Environmental Health Services, Nutrition, and Additional Enabling/Supportive Services. ACH also provides psychiatry services as a specialty service.\n\n[TEXT] ACH aligns with the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) initiative to advance national health equity and prevention goals. Through MAHA-aligned programs, ACH expands access to primary care, chronic disease management, and community-based education focused on nutrition, physical activity, and behavioral health. This initiative supports HRSA's priorities to reduce health disparities, prevent avoidable hospitalizations, and improve population health outcomes across medically underserved areas in both rural and urban communities throughout the United States.\n\n[TEXT] ACH continues to meet all performance standards established by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and the Department of Health and Human Services, while expanding medical services and adding new programs to meet emerging needs. In September 2024, ACH successfully completed a HRSA Operational Site Visit (OSV) under the HRSA Health Center Compliance Manual.\n\n[TEXT] With more than 65,000 annual patient visits and a half-century legacy of service, ACH continues to transform lives and strengthen community health outcomes. Its unwavering commitment to affordability, accessibility, and quality care has earned ACH its role as a trusted community health partner and essential provider throughout Wake and Franklin Counties.\n\n[TEXT] All services are consistent with those listed on Form 5A: Services Provided.\n\n[HEADING] NEED\n\n[TEXT] 1. Describe the proposed service area (consistent with Attachment 1: Service Area Map and Table), including:\n\n[TEXT] a. The service area boundaries.\n\n[TEXT] The proposed service area for Advance Community Health encompasses Franklin and Wake Counties in the eastern Piedmont region of North Carolina. Both counties are designated in whole or in part as Medically Underserved Areas (MUA) and Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSA), underscoring the critical need for expanded access to comprehensive primary care. The service area boundaries are drawn to include populations most affected by poverty, uninsured status, chronic disease, and limited access to private providers. These boundaries align with ACH's service delivery sites and ensure coverage across both urban and rural communities.\n\n[TEXT] Advance Community Health, Inc.

Population growth, density, and economic expansion have created increasing demand for affordable, accessible health services - particularly among low-income and uninsured residents. Between 2010 and 2020, Wake County's population increased by more than 25%, with continuing growth projected through 2030. Source(s): Carolina Demography; University of North Carolina, 2022.\n\n[TEXT] Franklin County, by contrast, is a smaller, rural county northeast of Wake. With limited transportation infrastructure - only two major U.S. highways - residents face barriers in reaching health care services. Many Franklin County residents commute to Wake County for employment, education, and care, highlighting the importance of ACH's integrated service delivery across county lines. The county's health system capacity is limited, with higher poverty rates and fewer providers per capita than the state average.\n\n[TEXT] Population Profile. The total service area population is 1,246,256, reflecting a 27.6% increase since 2010. Approximately 94% of residents live in Wake County, while Franklin County - though smaller shows concentrated need related to poverty, chronic disease, and transportation. The target population, defined as individuals living below 200% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG), totals 254,844 residents (20.5%) of the service area population.

How the boundaries of the service area ensure that services are available and accessible to the residents of the area.\n\n[TEXT] ACH defines its service area boundaries to align with the geographic regions where the greatest concentrations of medically underserved residents live, work, and seek care. The service area reflects the locations of ACH's clinical sites, the transportation patterns of patients, and the distribution of populations experiencing the highest levels of health disparities.\n\n[TEXT] · Geographic Alignment: The boundaries encompass neighborhoods and counties designated as MUA and HPSA, ensuring ACH services are targeted to communities with the greatest unmet need.\n\n[TEXT] · Proximity to Care: Clinical sites are strategically located within residential communities, near public transportation routes, and in areas accessible to patients traveling from rural areas. This ensures that residents can reach services without undue travel burden.\n\n[TEXT] . Population Reach: The service area boundary captures both urban and rural populations that rely on ACH as their primary health care home. It includes low-income families, agricultural workers, and uninsured or underinsured individuals who face significant barriers to accessing private or specialty care.\n\n[TEXT] · Accessibility Supports: Enabling services - including transportation assistance, care management, and translation - extend access to patients throughout the service area, ensuring that geography does not prevent residents from obtaining care. ACH also extends access through telehealth visits and after- hours on-call coverage, ensuring 24/7 access to clinical guidance.\n\n[TEXT] By intentionally defining the service area to match population need, transportation access, and site placement, ACH ensures that comprehensive, patient-centered services are available and accessible to all residents within its service area boundaries.\n\n[TEXT] d. How the overlap of political subdivisions, school districts, and areas served by Federal and State health and social programs affect access to primary health care services in the service area.\n\n[TEXT] ACH serves a defined service area where political subdivisions, school districts, and state and federal health and social programs often overlap. These overlaps present both opportunities and challenges in ensuring equitable access to primary health care.\n\n[TEXT] · Political Subdivisions: The service area includes multiple counties and municipalities with varying levels of public health infrastructure, transportation options, and funding priorities. Differences in local government resources can create uneven access to care; ACH mitigates this by ensuring consistent services across its clinical sites and providing enabling services such as transportation coordination and care management.\n\n[TEXT] Advance Community Health, Inc.

School Districts: The presence of multiple school districts across the service area creates opportunities for ACH to extend pediatric and adolescent services, including school-based health initiatives, immunization partnerships, and health education. However, variations in district-level funding and resources can affect the availability of school health staff, reinforcing ACH's role as a trusted partner in ensuring children and adolescents receive preventive and primary care services.\n\n[TEXT] . Federal and State Health and Social Programs: The service area includes populations eligible for Medicaid, Medicare, WIC, SNAP, and housing assistance programs. Program requirements, eligibility thresholds, and availability of services may vary by county or administering agency, creating complexity for patients. ACH helps patients navigate these systems through benefits counseling, application support, and referrals, ensuring that they can maximize available resources to support their health.\n\n[TEXT] Overall, these overlaps reinforce the importance of ACH's coordinated, patient-centered model of care. By working across political boundaries, partnering with multiple school systems, and integrating with state and federal social service programs, ACH reduces fragmentation and ensures that all residents in the service area can access comprehensive, high-quality primary care, regardless of where they live or which jurisdiction they fall under.\n\n[TEXT] e. How you will annually review the proposed service area to identify where your patients reside, available health resources, and unmet need.\n\n[TEXT] ACH conducts an annual review of its service area to ensure alignment between where patients reside, the availability of local health resources, and emerging areas of unmet need. Following submission of the annual Uniform Data System (UDS) report, ACH analyzes patient origin data by ZIP code to determine where the majority of patients live. These ZIP codes are then compared with those listed on Form 5B: Service Sites to confirm accuracy and completeness.\n\n[TEXT] If any ZIP code representing at least 75% of ACH's total patient population is not reflected on Form 5B, ACH identifies the service site serving those patients and submits a Change in Scope request to add the ZIP code to that site. For this application, ACH also reviewed the Service Area Announcement Table (SAAT) to verify that all ZIP codes where at least 75% of patients reside are accurately represented on Form 5B.\n\n[TEXT] Beyond ensuring scope accuracy, this annual review helps ACH monitor population shifts, evaluate areas experiencing growth or increased demand, and identify emerging service gaps. This analysis informs strategic planning, site development, and resource allocation to ensure that ACH continues to effectively meet the health care needs of residents throughout its service area. ACH is a sponsoring partner with Wake County's Community Health Needs Assessment group and uses information from the CHNA to inform services offered, hours of operation, and other identified needs.\n\n[TEXT] f.

The Hispanic/Latino share grew from 31% to 38%, and those best served in a language other than English rose from 25.6% to 31.1%, underscoring the need for expanded bilingual staffing, interpreter services, and culturally tailored health education.\n\n[TEXT] . Economic Vulnerability and Coverage. Nearly 99% of patients are ≤200% FPL and 86% are ≤100% FPL (+10 points since 2022), indicating heightened economic need and reliance on sliding fee and enabling services. The uninsured rate declined from 32% to 27%, while Medicaid/CHIP edged up (41.1% -> 41.4%) and other third-party coverage increased (12% -> ~20%), reflecting payer diversification and improved financial stability. The uninsured rate is also higher in Franklin County (13%) than the state (11%) and national (10%) averages, further limiting access to consistent primary and preventive care.\n\n[TEXT] . Medicaid Expansion Impact. North Carolina's Medicaid expansion (effective Dec 1, 2023) is already reshaping the payer mix by shifting adults from uninsured to Medicaid. ACH's Outreach and Enrollment team continues assisting with applications, renewals, and benefits literacy - supporting prevention, chronic care continuity, and reduced uncompensated care.\n\n[TEXT] · Service Utilization. Demand for comprehensive care continues to rise. Dental patients increased nearly 40% (3,054 -> 4,262) following capacity investments and targeted outreach. Behavioral health utilization also increased alongside growth in the integrated Behavioral Health model. Although the proportion of medical patients declined, overall encounters remained stable - a normalization effect as dental and BH volumes expanded and post-COVID coding stabilized.\n\n[TEXT] · Special Populations. ACH served 870 individuals experiencing homelessness in 2024 - still substantial, though a smaller share due to total patient growth. The Health Care for the Homeless program provides mobile and on-site medical, dental, and behavioral health services, with care management for housing, employment, and recovery support. Engagement with Migratory and Seasonal Agricultural Workers (MSAW) populations rose (132 in 2024), and public-housing-associated patients increased by ~11% due to the opening of a service delivery location in 4/2024 adjacent to public housing (added ). Since 2023, school-based partnerships have expanded preventive and behavioral health access for children/adolescents.\n\n[TEXT] · Community Health Environment. Regional population growth, private-sector workforce shortages, and persistent social risk factors (food insecurity, transportation, housing) have increased ACH's role as a safety-net provider. ACH has maintained and grown patient engagement via community partnerships, care coordination, and enabling services.\n\n[TEXT] Source(s): UDS 2022 - 2024; County Health Rankings 2024.

The region includes multiple Medically Underserved Areas/Populations (MUA/Ps), HPSAs, and federally designated Opportunity Zones. Despite regional economic growth, significant gaps remain in access to affordable, comprehensive, and culturally competent care - particularly among low-income, uninsured, and minority populations. ACH's integrated model of care - grounded in prevention, chronic-disease management, and behavioral health integration - addresses these disparities by ensuring that high-quality services are accessible to all residents, regardless of ability to pay.\n\n[TEXT] Health Care for the Homeless. Wake and Franklin Counties include a substantial and growing population experiencing homelessness. The Wake County Continuum of Care identified more than 1,200 individuals in the most recent Point-in-Time count, including those living unsheltered or in emergency and transitional housing. Rising housing costs and limited affordable units have contributed to this increase. Individuals experiencing homelessness face higher rates of chronic illness, behavioral health disorders, and substance-use conditions, often complicated by limited access to hygiene, medication storage, and follow- up care.\n\n[TEXT] ACH's Health Care for the Homeless program delivers mobile and on-site medical, dental, and behavioral health services at shelters, and outreach sites. Care management staff assist with housing applications, employment resources, and linkage to recovery and behavioral health programs. Through strong partnerships with local shelters, food pantries, and housing agencies, ACH ensures care continuity for unsheltered and temporarily housed individuals and families.\n\n[TEXT] These activities align with HRSA's expectations for outreach and service delivery to individuals experiencing homelessness under Section 330(h).\n\n[TEXT] a.

By offering both required and additional services, ACH ensures that patients have access to comprehensive, integrated care that addresses medical, behavioral, and social drivers of health.\n\n[HEADING] Clinical Data Summary (UDS 2022-2024)\n\n[TEXT] ACH's clinical and population health data show consistent growth in patient volume, improved performance across several preventive and chronic disease measures, and continued emphasis on closing health disparities. Total patients increased from 18,704 in 2022 to 21,538 in 2024 (+15%), reflecting both expanded access and increased community demand.\n\n[HEADING] Chronic Disease Trends.\n\n[TEXT] · Hypertension: Hypertension remains the most prevalent chronic condition among ACH patients. The share of adult patients diagnosed with hypertension rose slightly from 43.1% (2022) to 46.2% (2024), reflecting enhanced screening and identification efforts. Blood pressure control (<140/90 mmHg) improved significantly - from 53.3% (2022) to 62.2% (2024) - a nine-percentage-point gain in two years. This reflects successful implementation of care coordination, adherence follow-up, and clinical decision-support tools within ACH's EpicCare Ambulatory (Epic) electronic health record (EHR).\n\n[TEXT] . Diabetes: The proportion of adults with diabetes remained stable (28.2% -> 27.2%), while those with poorly controlled A1c (>9% or no test) rose from 25.8% -> 44.2%, prompting intensified outreach, point-of-care A1c testing, and adherence counseling.\n\n[TEXT] . Asthma: Prevalence held steady (6.6% -> 7.1%). Clinical teams monitor medication compliance and environmental triggers through integrated primary-care and behavioral health coordination.\n\n[TEXT] . HIV: Although a small portion of total patients (0.3% -> 0.5%), the number living with HIV increased from 54 to 82, consistent with regional epidemiologic trends. ACH continues to provide screening, linkage-to-care, and care management to maintain viral suppression. To address patient needs, ACH provides access to a part-time (0.8 FTE) nurse practitioner specializing in HIV care.\n\n[TEXT] Cardiovascular Risk Reduction. Preventive cardiovascular care indicators remain strong and show incremental improvement:\n\n[TEXT] · Statin therapy: Increased from 76.9% (2022) to 80.6% (2024), exceeding national health-center averages.\n\n[TEXT] · Aspirin/antiplatelet use (IVD): Stable at 80.5% -> 79.0%, reflecting sustained adherence to secondary prevention standards.\n\n[TEXT] Preventive Health Performance.

Prenatal care patients increased from 64 (2022) to 94 (2024) (+47%). Early entry into prenatal care (first trimester) improved from 50.0% -> 71.3%, surpassing pre-pandemic levels and ranking in the national second quartile. This progress reflects strengthened referral systems and proactive identification of pregnant patients by ACH's outreach and care coordination teams. ACH provides OB/GYN services including voluntary family planning, prenatal services, ultrasounds, and lactation services as a part of an overall comprehensive approach to addressing women's health needs (OB opened in 12/2024).\n\n[TEXT] Behavioral Health and Integration. Behavioral health integration continues to expand. Depression screening increased to 74.9%, with improved follow-up documentation. Depression remission at 12 months reached 10.0% in 2024, showing gradual progress and highlighting the need for sustained behavioral health follow-up and telehealth therapy options.\n\n[TEXT] ACH's performance trajectory demonstrates sustained improvement in chronic-disease control, preventive screening, and behavioral health integration.

High rates of poverty, limited transportation, housing instability, and food insecurity are common across the service area. ACH provides a comprehensive array of enabling and patient-support services to mitigate these barriers.\n\n[TEXT] Each patient completes an annual social drivers of health assessment through the EHR. Identified needs - such as food insecurity, financial strain, or transportation challenges - trigger immediate connections to enabling-service staff or community partners. Patients receive assistance with insurance enrollment, transportation coordination, care management, and linkage to social-service programs.\n\n[TEXT] Every patient requiring enhanced support is assigned a care coordinator or care manager who helps navigate medical, behavioral, and community resources. Care managers focus on clinical goals, while coordinators guide patients and families to need support, including vouchers for healthy food, housing resources, and job training opportunities. ACH's care management continuum extends into home and community settings, ensuring post-hospital follow-up and continuity for high-risk or chronically ill patients.\n\n[TEXT] Since January through October 2025, ACH staff delivered more than 10,800 enabling and supportive service encounters to ACH patients - strengthening access, improving care coordination, and addressing social drivers of health.\n\n[TEXT] These services - beyond required case management - have provided patients with critical connections to non-medical, social, and educational resources, including transportation, food access, Medicaid eligibility, and health education. Notably, the largest areas of impact include:\n\n[TEXT] · Coordinating care and transitions across settings (4,014 encounters), ensuring continuity after hospital or specialty visits.\n\n[TEXT] · Health and wellness outreach (2,043 calls) to support preventive care and patient engagement.\n\n[TEXT] · Case management and care gap outreach (1,578 combined encounters) to address chronic disease management, missed visits, and preventive screenings.\n\n[TEXT] · Transportation assistance (391 encounters) to remove access barriers for medically underserved patients.\n\n[TEXT] Additional services include language interpretation, clinical pharmacist interventions, and group education sessions, reflecting ACH's comprehensive, patient-centered approach.\n\n[TEXT] These results underscore ACH's ability to rapidly deploy enabling services infrastructure, integrate outreach and care coordination functions, and meet HRSA expectations for comprehensive, accessible, and equitable care across the expanded service area.\n\n[HEADING] c.

Describe any recent or potential changes in the local health care landscape and how those changes may affect the needs of the target population.\n\n[TEXT] The ACH service area is amid massive shifts that impact patient access, our workforce, and sustainability.\n\n[TEXT] North Carolina Medicaid Expansion. The 2023 decision to expand Medicaid in NC began a flurry of activity to increase health care access to eligible patients has served as the catalyst for current and potential changes in Wake and Franklin Counties. The biggest change is patient demand for accessible and affordable care, which creates competition and the need for Advance to expand and enhance required services. In the coming months, as Medicaid guidelines change, we anticipate a spike in the number of uninsured and underinsured patients needing access to our services and programs. Our growing patient base will need to leverage the essential structure of our health center: SFDS (Sliding Fee Discount Schedule), same day access, and enabling services to ensure their wellbeing.\n\n[TEXT] Workforce. Not only do we have a responsibility to hire and train the next generation of health care professionals, but we also have a responsibility to ensure workforce is deployed to areas of greatest need. In both counties that complete our service area there are multiple community reports of office and hospital closures that only increase the demand for qualified providers. In many cases we are creating strategies to support these practices via managed services to ensure quality and access are maintained in our community. The sustainability of primary care, especially in the rural designated parts of our service area, is essential. Advance is the measured and documented safety net for Wake and Franklin counties.\n\n[TEXT] Reimbursement. As of Oct 1, 2025, Medicaid reimbursement across North Carolina was reduced by 3%. This policy will not change how we provide care, however; it will challenge our overall mission - less resources for patients that need access. Again, as the safety net for Wake and Franklin counites, thousands of years working families are depending on the ACH system to manage their care, support their health goals, and assist them in navigating an ever-changing health care landscape.

Regularly update your Scope of Project in response to the needs for additional services.\n\n[TEXT] ACH maintains a formal, structured process for monitoring community and patient needs and updating its HRSA-approved Scope of Project to ensure that services remain responsive, comprehensive, and compliant with federal requirements.\n\n[TEXT] Each year, ACH conducts a detailed review of patient demographic, utilization, and outcome data, including UDS reports, local community health assessments, and feedback gathered from patients, providers, and staff, to identify emerging health trends, service gaps, and opportunities to expand or refine care delivery. When analysis indicates the need for additional services or delivery methods, ACH evaluates feasibility, financial impact, and alignment with organizational priorities, HRSA expectations, and the needs identified in the CHNA.\n\n[TEXT] Proposed additions or modifications are reviewed by the Executive Leadership Team, Quality Improvement Committee, and Board of Trustees to ensure consistency with ACH's mission, strategic goals, and long- term sustainability. If a proposed change meets HRSA's definition of an in-scope addition, deletion, or modification, a formal Change in Scope (CIS) request is submitted for HRSA approval prior to implementation.\n\n[TEXT] In addition to annual reviews, ACH continuously monitors new initiatives, grant-funded programs, and strategic partnerships that may necessitate adjustments to the approved Scope of Project. This ongoing process ensures that ACH's service mix, delivery sites, and modalities - including in-person, mobile, and telehealth services - remain aligned with evolving community needs and HRSA requirements.\n\n[TEXT] By maintaining this proactive and systematic approach, ACH ensures that its Scope of Project accurately reflects the organization's capacity, supports equitable access to care, and advances the mission of Advance Community Health, Inc.

Use patient and community input to inform and improve your service delivery.\n\n[TEXT] ACH actively engages patients and community stakeholders to ensure that its services remain responsive to local needs and aligned with the populations it serves. Patient and community input is gathered through multiple structured channels, analyzed by leadership, and incorporated into ongoing planning, quality improvement, and service delivery decisions. Including but not limited to the following engagement:\n\n[TEXT] . Patient Input. ACH's Board of Trustees, of which more than 51% are health center patients, plays a central role in representing the voice of the patient community. The Board provides ongoing oversight and guidance on policies, services, and access issues that impact patient experience and outcomes. In addition, ACH regularly conducts patient satisfaction surveys, focus groups, and post-visit feedback opportunities to capture patient perspectives on access, quality, communication, and cultural competence. Survey data are reviewed by site leadership and the Quality Improvement Committee to identify trends and implement corrective actions or enhancements.\n\n[TEXT] · Community Input. ACH collaborates closely with community organizations, local health departments, school systems, housing agencies, and faith-based partners to assess needs and coordinate services. Input is also gathered through participation in community health assessments, regional coalitions, and stakeholder forums. These collaborations provide insight into emerging public health priorities, social drivers of health, and gaps in available community resources.\n\n[TEXT] · Continuous Improvement. Findings from patient and community feedback are reviewed and integrated into ACH's Quality Improvement and Strategic Planning processes. This ensures that service enhancements - such as expanded hours, new programs, or additional enabling services - are directly informed by the voices of those served.\n\n[TEXT] Through this structured approach, ACH ensures that patients and community members remain active partners in shaping accessible, high-quality, and culturally responsive care throughout the service area.\n\n[HEADING] RESPONSE\n\n[TEXT] ACH proudly serves Wake and Franklin Counties, North Carolina, operating twelve permanent service delivery sites, one administrative/service delivery site, one mobile unit, and one administrative office to maximize access across the service area. As a vital access point for medically underserved residents, ACH's care delivery model is built on reducing health disparities, increasing access to essential services, and eliminating barriers to comprehensive care. The health center provides multiple, geographically convenient points of entry to primary care as a core strategy for improving access across its target population. ACH's family- and community-oriented approach ensures the delivery of integrated services across all stages of life - from pediatrics to geriatrics - promoting continuity of care, patient trust, and improved long-term outcomes.\n\n[TEXT] ACH ensures that all required services are available to patients either directly or through formal referral arrangements. These services include General Primary Care, Diagnostic Laboratory, Diagnostic Radiology, Screenings, Coverage for Emergencies During and After Hours, Voluntary Family Planning, Immunizations, Advance Community Health, Inc.

These include Additional Dental Services, Mental Health Services, Environmental Health Services, Nutrition, and Additional Enabling/Supportive Services. ACH also provides psychiatry services as a specialty service.\n\n[TEXT] ACH aligns with the Make America Healthy Again initiative to advance national health equity and prevention goals. Through MAHA-aligned programs, ACH expands access to primary care, chronic disease management, and community-based education focused on nutrition, physical activity, and behavioral health. This initiative supports HRSA's priorities to reduce health disparities, prevent avoidable hospitalizations, and improve population health outcomes across medically underserved areas in both rural and urban communities throughout the United States.\n\n[TEXT] The ACH coordinated service delivery network ensures that all individuals, regardless of income or insurance status, have equitable access to the full scope of in-house and referral services throughout the service area.\n\n[TEXT] 1. Describe how the proposed service delivery sites on Form 5B: Service Sites will support access to your services (consistent with Form 5A: Services Provided) and minimize barriers within the proposed service area, including:\n\n[TEXT] a. Where your service delivery sites are located, compared to where the target population lives and works.\n\n[TEXT] ACH has strategically located its service delivery sites and mobile unit (Form 5B) to maximize accessibility for the target population and ensure full alignment with the scope of services provided (Form 5A). Each site is positioned in neighborhoods with the highest concentrations of medically underserved residents - areas characterized by high poverty rates, chronic disease burden, and limited access to private health care providers. Strategic locations include:\n\n[TEXT] . Proximity to Patients' Homes and Workplaces: ACH sites are located in or near communities where most patients live and work, reducing transportation barriers and improving convenience for families and working adults.\n\n[TEXT] · Accessible to Employment Centers and Schools: Several sites are situated near major employment corridors, schools, and public housing complexes, enabling patients to seek care without missing work or school.\n\n[TEXT] . Urban and Rural Reach: ACH maintains a balanced network of urban and rural locations to serve both densely populated areas and remote communities. Rural sites reduce travel time for isolated residents, while urban clinics reach economically disadvantaged populations facing access challenges within the city. ACH has a mobile clinic that brings primary care, screenings, chronic care management, and other services directly to neighborhoods and schools, mitigating geographic and transportation barriers.\n\n[TEXT] Advance Community Health, Inc.

Recent Expansion Reflects Responsiveness: In 2024-2025, ACH added six new or expanded sites in direct response to community-identified needs. This growth demonstrates ACH's ability to adapt quickly to demand, expand capacity for primary, dental, and behavioral health services, and sustain access for vulnerable residents across the service area.\n\n[TEXT] Minimizing Barriers to Care. ACH minimizes barriers by pairing strategic site placement with patient- focused access supports. Each location maintains hours and services designed to meet the community's needs. Same-day and walk-in appointments are available at all sites, and patients can schedule visits via the patient portal, by phone or in person to accommodate varying levels of digital access.\n\n[TEXT] . Public Transportation Access: Most sites are located along major bus routes or community transit lines.\n\n[TEXT] · Extended Hours: Select locations offer evening and weekend hours to accommodate working families.\n\n[TEXT] · Enabling Services: Transportation coordination, interpretation, and benefits-enrollment assistance ensure that geography, language, or income do not prevent patients from accessing care.\n\n[TEXT] In addition, ACH operates a multi-disciplinary mobile unit that delivers medical, dental, and behavioral health services directly to underserved populations across its service area. The mobile unit provides critical flexibility, enabling ACH to remain nimble and responsive to emerging community needs. By bringing care to where residents naturally congregate - such as homeless shelters, soup kitchens, community centers, public housing, churches, and schools - ACH eliminates traditional barriers to access and strengthens its connection with the community.\n\n[TEXT] This mobile outreach model has become a core component of ACH's growth strategy, expanding access to comprehensive, integrated care while fostering trust, engagement, and early intervention among hard-to- reach populations.\n\n[TEXT] More than 90% of ACH patients reside within 10 miles of a service site (less with the ACH mobile capabilities), confirming that the network effectively reaches the populations most affected by poverty, chronic disease, and limited provider availability. Through intentional expansion and accessibility supports, ACH ensures that comprehensive, patient-centered services remain available, accessible, and equitable for all residents throughout its service area.\n\n[TEXT] Location (Site Name and Address)\n\n[TEXT] Services\n\n[TEXT] Hours of Operation\n\n[TEXT] Total Hours\n\n[TEXT] Service Delivery - Wake County\n\n[TEXT] Advance CarePlex - Wake Forest 110 Capcom Ave STE 103 Wake Forest, NC 27587-3219\n\n[TEXT] Medical Behavioral Health\n\n[TEXT] M-F 8am - 5pm\n\n[TEXT] 40\n\n[TEXT] Closed daily 1 hour for lunch\n\n[TEXT] Starlight Pediatrics 500 Holly Springs Road, Ste 101 Holly Springs, NC 27540-6204\n\n[TEXT] Pediatrics Only Behavioral Health\n\n[TEXT] M-F 9am - 5pm\n\n[TEXT] 36\n\n[TEXT] Closed M-Thurs 1 hour for lunch\n\n[TEXT] Apex 212 S Salem St Apex, NC 27502-1825\n\n[TEXT] Medical\n\n[TEXT] M-F 8am - 5pm\n\n[TEXT] 40\n\n[TEXT] Behavioral Health\n\n[TEXT] Closed daily 1 hour for lunch\n\n[TEXT] Advance Community Health, Inc.

How you will address geographic barriers, location of sites, and hours of operation.\n\n[TEXT] ACH is committed to ensuring that every resident of Wake and Franklin Counties has access to comprehensive, high-quality, and affordable care - regardless of geographic, transportation, or scheduling barriers. ACH continuously evaluates the service area in partnership with the North Carolina Community Health Center Association (NCCHCA), neighboring health centers, and community safety-net organizations to identify areas where primary care shortages and access gaps persist.\n\n[TEXT] Addressing Geographic Barriers. ACH serves both densely populated urban neighborhoods and rural, medically underserved communities. Patients in Franklin County often face rural access challenges such as long travel distances, limited provider availability, and inadequate public transportation options. In contrast, patients in urban Wake County may encounter heavy traffic congestion, lack of reliable transit in certain neighborhoods, and difficulty obtaining care near their homes or workplaces. To address these issues, ACH collaborates with county agencies and local partners to provide transportation assistance, including ride-share or community transit vouchers. Care Coordinators assist patients in scheduling appointments and connecting to community-based transit programs, ensuring that transportation is never a barrier to receiving care.\n\n[TEXT] Location of Sites. ACH has strategically located its clinical sites in medically underserved and high-need areas to maximize accessibility for the populations most in need. Sites are geographically distributed across both Wake and Franklin Counties to provide a balance of rural and urban access. The placement of sites aligns with population density, poverty concentrations, and health-disparity indicators identified through ongoing needs assessments. Expansion of service locations since the last SAC application, demonstrates ACH's intentional commitment to reducing travel times and aligning services with where patients live, work, and attend school. As shared above, ACH has the flexibility to respond to community needs with mobile medical, dental, and behavioral health.\n\n[TEXT] Advance Community Health, Inc.

To further enhance accessibility, ACH offers extended hours at key locations, including early morning, evening, and weekend appointments. Same-day appointments and dedicated urgent-care slots support patients with acute needs, while telehealth visits provide a convenient option for patients unable to travel to a clinic. For urgent concerns after regular business hours, ACH provides 24/7 access through its after-hours and on-call offerings, which connect patients to an on-call licensed provider via the professional answering service, ensuring continuity of care and timely clinical advice.\n\n[TEXT] Through strategic site placement, extended hours, HIPAA-compliant telehealth with Epic integration, and robust enabling services, ACH effectively minimizes the impact of geographic and logistical barriers. These coordinated efforts ensure that all members of the target population - whether rural, urban, working, uninsured, or transportation-limited - can access timely, patient-centered care that supports equitable health outcomes across the region.\n\n[TEXT] Collectively, these integrated strategies ensure that all patients within the service area can readily access ACH primary, dental, and behavioral health services without geographic or financial barriers.\n\n[TEXT] c.

How you assess all patients for sliding fee discount eligibility based only on income and family size. See income definition in Chapter 9: Sliding Fee Discount Program of the Compliance Manual.\n\n[TEXT] ACH provides services according to a Board-approved SFDP based solely on income and family size, consistent with Chapter 9 of HRSA's Compliance Manual. The SFDS applies to patients with incomes up to 200% of the FPG.\n\n[TEXT] ACH utilizes written policies and procedures to implement the SFDS. These policies and procedures define income and family size, specify documentation or verification requirements for determining and recording family size and income, detail the specific structure for the SFDS itself, establish the frequency for re- evaluation of patient eligibility, and address provisions for waiving fees and nominal charges for specific patient circumstances.\n\n[TEXT] Family size and income are verified using official documentation to determine wages and salary, excluding assets and other similar items, consistent with HRSA definitions. These figures are compared to the annually published FPG. ACH follows HRSA's definition of \"family,\" which is a group of two or more persons related by birth, marriage, or adoption who live together; all such related persons are considered members of one family.\n\n[TEXT] Eligibility determinations are conducted respectfully, confidentially, and in a culturally appropriate manner to avoid barriers to care. Acceptable income documentation includes recent pay stubs, tax returns, or other verifiable proof of earnings; assets are not considered.\n\n[TEXT] When patients inquire about or are invited to apply for the Sliding Fee Discount Program, front-office staff or Patient Financial Navigators provide assistance with completing the application. Applications are reviewed and updated annually, or sooner if there is a change in household income or size. For patients who are unemployed, report zero income, or are homeless or transitioning from homelessness, eligibility is re-evaluated every six months to ensure continued accuracy.\n\n[TEXT] Patients without income documentation may self-declare income for one visit per year; documentation must be provided at the next visit or the patient is classified as self-pay.\n\n[TEXT] For homeless individuals, ACH follows Section 330 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. § 254b) and Bureau of Primary Health Care definitions of homelessness. Per guidance, an individual may be considered homeless if they are \"doubled up\" with others, or if they are a previously homeless person being discharged from a hospital, prison, or similar institution without stable housing to return to. All patients who identify as homeless, regardless of insurance status, must provide documentation of their homeless status consistent with this definition. Acceptable documentation includes a certification letter from a shelter or social service agency or correlating verification forms such as household instability or \"doubled-up\" documentation. This documentation is attached to the patient's SFDP application to ensure eligibility determination aligns with HRSA requirements.\n\n[TEXT] Advance Community Health, Inc.

How you adjust patient charges based on the ability to pay (consistent with Attachment 10: Sliding Fee Discount Schedule).\n\n[TEXT] ACH adjusts patient charges based on ability to pay through its Board-approved SFDP. Discounts are applied using a SFDS aligned with the most recent FPG and determined by verified household income and family size.\n\n[TEXT] The SFDP applies to all individuals and families with annual incomes between 100% and 200% of the FPG. Discounts (flat or percentage-based) are applied consistently across all service types, including medical, behavioral health, dental, nursing, nutrition, pharmacy, urgent care, integrated care, and OB/GYN.\n\n[TEXT] Patients with annual incomes at or below 100% of the FPG are charged only a nominal fee, while those between 101% and 200% of the FPG receive graduated discounts. The SFDS includes four pay classes above 100% FPG - 101-125%, 126-150%, 151-175%, and 176-200%. No sliding fee discount is approved for individuals or families with incomes exceeding 200% of the FPG.\n\n[TEXT] All services are billed at their full established charge, and discounts are applied according to each patient's verified eligibility level. Uninsured patients and those who are underinsured (with self-pay balances such as co-payments or deductibles) are encouraged to apply for the SFDP.\n\n[TEXT] Eligibility is determined and documented annually, based on verification of income and household size, and reassessed whenever a change in financial circumstances occurs. ACH ensures that no patient is denied care due to inability to pay, thereby maintaining equitable access to all health center services.\n\n[TEXT] Each year, the Board of Trustees, comprised of a patient-majority membership, reviews and approves the SFDS to incorporate the most recent FPG. As part of this review, the Board evaluates the structure and effectiveness of the discount schedule to ensure it continues to reduce financial barriers to care. This includes reviewing UDS data, practice management system financial reports, and patient satisfaction survey results to assess whether patients across all discount pay classes are accessing care.\n\n[TEXT] In conjunction with this annual review, ACH's policies and procedures governing implementation of the sliding fee scale are also reviewed and updated as needed to ensure continued compliance with HRSA's Sliding Fee Discount Program requirements.\n\n[TEXT] c.

The nominal fee is intended solely to encourage shared responsibility and not to create a financial barrier to care.\n\n[TEXT] Examples (effective 05/01/2025-03/31/2026) include:\n\n[TEXT] . $40 for medical or behavioral health visits\n\n[TEXT] · $60 for dental visits\n\n[TEXT] · $10 for nurse visits\n\n[TEXT] · $17 for nutrition services\n\n[TEXT] · $10.50 for pharmacy dispensing\n\n[TEXT] · $125 for urgent care visits\n\n[TEXT] · $75 for integrated care visits\n\n[TEXT] · Fee per procedure for OB/GYN\n\n[TEXT] d. How you evaluate your sliding fee discount program to ensure that it reduces financial barriers to care.\n\n[TEXT] ACH regularly evaluates its SFDP to ensure it effectively reduces financial barriers and promotes equitable access to care.\n\n[TEXT] The nominal and discount fee schedules are reviewed annually by the Board of Trustees to ensure continued affordability and alignment with the most current FPG. As part of this review, ACH analyzes utilization data, patient satisfaction survey results, and feedback from front-line staff and Patient Financial Navigators to assess whether fees remain reasonable and non-restrictive for low-income patients.\n\n[TEXT] To further prevent financial hardship, ACH works directly with patients to establish payment plans when needed. In cases where nominal fees pose a financial burden, waivers or alternative arrangements may be granted. Waiver authority is delegated to the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Medical Officer, and Director of Patient Financial Services, with requests initiated by practice managers or providers.\n\n[TEXT] ACH also monitors self-pay and uninsured visit trends, missed appointment rates, and collections data as part of its QI monitoring process. These findings are presented to the Board of Trustees during the annual SFDS review for consideration of any adjustments to fee structures or pay classes. Modifications are made as needed to ensure the SFDP continues to reduce financial barriers, maintain affordability, and support equitable access to all health center services.\n\n[TEXT] 6.

Through the Epic EHR system, including the integrated MyChart patient portal, patients have secure access to their visit summaries, laboratory results, and educational materials, supporting transparency, self-management, and ongoing engagement in care.\n\n[TEXT] Families and caregivers are involved in care planning when appropriate, particularly for pediatric, geriatric, and behavioral health patients. With patient consent, care teams communicate with caregivers to coordinate follow-up, reinforce treatment adherence, and provide social and emotional support.\n\n[TEXT] ACH employs care coordinators who serve as health navigators integrated within its medical, dental, and behavioral health teams. These staff members help patients, especially those with complex medical or social needs, navigate the health care system, understand their care plans, and maintain continuity of care. They provide education on preventive services, assist with insurance enrollment, and address social drivers of health such as transportation, housing, and food insecurity.\n\n[TEXT] ACH's care model is designed to meet the unique needs of low-income, uninsured, underinsured, homeless, and rural residents of Wake and Franklin Counties. Services are delivered by bilingual, culturally competent staff and supported by targeted community outreach events to increase access and reduce health disparities.

Follow-up for patients who are hospitalized or visit a hospital's emergency department.\n\n[TEXT] ACH ensures continuity of care through well-defined communication systems, referral processes, electronic data exchange, and coordinated follow-up for patients receiving services both within and outside the health center network. ACH utilizes the Epic EHR system, which includes the Care Everywhere interoperability feature to securely exchange patient health information with external partners - such as hospitals, specialists, and other health care providers. Referral orders and care coordination activities are documented in the EHR to ensure providers have timely access to patient records and care plans. Referral staff coordinate and track external referrals to ensure receipt of consultation notes and test results, and the Care Management Department reviews all referrals to ensure follow-up is completed in accordance with care plans. Data sharing occurs securely through the NC Health Information Exchange (NCHIE) and integrated hospital portals. Communication tools such as direct messaging, patient portal communication, and phone follow-ups support timely coordination with patients and external partners.\n\n[TEXT] Advance Community Health, Inc.

Instead, ACH maintains formal referral and communication protocols with area hospitals to facilitate inpatient coordination, data sharing, and post-discharge transitions. Hospitalists and emergency department physicians provide inpatient care, while ACH providers resume primary care management upon discharge. Continuity of care following hospitalization or emergency department use is a key quality focus. Providers document all hospital and emergency referrals in Epic, including the receiving facility, reason for transfer, and diagnosis. The Care Management team accesses hospital discharge data daily, contacts patients, reviews discharge instructions, reconciles medications, and schedules follow-up visits within seven days post-discharge.\n\n[TEXT] HIE network participants include WakeMed and UNC REX Hospital, which assists in coordination of care and follow-up. If an ACH patient is admitted other than through a referral, hospitalists notify ACH through the EHR. Nurse Care Managers employed by ACH are embedded on-site at partner hospitals and meet with ACH patients upon admission or discharge to coordinate post-hospital care. This includes scheduling follow-up visits and ensuring a smooth transition back to primary care.\n\n[TEXT] For after-hours emergencies, ACH's 24-hour on-call system ensures patients have immediate access to a licensed provider for triage and referral to appropriate care. During clinic hours, medical emergencies are managed by the Medical Emergencies and Emergency Transport Policy until EMS arrives.\n\n[TEXT] In accordance with ACH's Hospitalization Tracking Policy, all hospitalizations and emergency department visits (excluding behavioral health) are tracked through the EHR. When notified of a hospitalization or emergency department visit, clinical staff log into the EpicCare Everywhere admission and discharge portal to import discharge summaries into the EHR, while the Care Management Department contacts the patient to schedule a follow-up appointment within seven days. Care Managers review discharge records, conduct medication reconciliation, update care plans, and ensure appropriate Care Management enrollment. ACH staff make three outreach attempts within a seven-day period using at least two methods, including telephone, mail, chart messaging, email, or fax. If the patient cannot be reached, a letter is sent, and ACH uses best efforts and available resources to locate and engage the patient, including pharmacy and hospital outreach, family contact, and searches through NCHIE.\n\n[TEXT] To ensure HRSA compliance, ACH tracks hospitalization follow-up appointments monthly. Results of continuity-of-care metrics (hospital follow-up within seven days, closed referral rates, and 30-day readmission rates) are reported quarterly to the QI/QA Committee and incorporated into ACH's UDS performance reviews. The Data Analyst and site Practice Managers perform regular audits submitted to the Risk Manager and/or Compliance Officer to monitor adherence and outcomes. All follow-up activities, patient contacts, and external reports are documented in the EHR to ensure seamless coordination across care settings. Monitoring and data reporting are conducted under ACH's Program Monitoring and Data Systems Policy to ensure accurate, timely analysis of service utilization and performance trends, reinforcing ACH's commitment to continuous quality improvement and comprehensive, coordinated patient care.\n\n[TEXT] 8.

Describe how you collaborate with community partners to increase awareness of and address the community's health and health-related needs.\n\n[TEXT] ACH has a long history of collaborating with diverse community partners to both increase awareness of available services and address the broad health and health-related needs of its service area. ACH recognizes that improving community health outcomes requires strong, sustained partnerships that extend beyond the health center walls.\n\n[TEXT] . Awareness and Outreach: ACH works with schools, faith-based organizations, social service agencies, and local employers to provide health education, screenings, and information about available services. Partnerships with local media outlets and community-based coalitions amplify outreach campaigns on preventive care, vaccination, and chronic disease management. ACH also engages trusted community leaders to increase awareness among populations that may face cultural, linguistic, or economic barriers to care.\n\n[TEXT] · Addressing Social Drivers of Health: Through collaboration with housing agencies, food banks, transportation providers, and workforce development organizations, ACH connects patients to critical enabling services. These partnerships ensure patients have access to housing stability, healthy foods, reliable transportation, and job resources - factors that directly influence health outcomes.\n\n[TEXT] . Public Health and Health System Partnerships: ACH coordinates closely with local health departments, hospitals, and behavioral health providers to align care, respond to public health priorities, and improve transitions of care. Joint initiatives include immunization drives, chronic disease prevention programs, and emergency preparedness responses, ensuring that vulnerable populations receive timely and coordinated support.\n\n[TEXT] · Community Engagement and Needs Assessment: ACH involves community partners in its formal needs assessment process to identify emerging health challenges, set priorities, and co-develop solutions. These relationships ensure that services remain responsive to evolving community needs and that interventions are tailored to populations most at risk.\n\n[TEXT] Through these partnerships, ACH enhances community trust, expands access to services, and builds a stronger safety net to address both health and health-related needs. This collaborative approach strengthens ACH's role as a pillar of community health for more than 50 years.\n\n[TEXT] 2.

The number of patients with poor control mirrored these trends, from 1,326 in 2020 to 1,364 in 2024.\n\n[TEXT] The 2024 increase likely reflects both improved screening and inclusion of new patients reestablishing care post-pandemic. In response, the health center has intensified its diabetes management efforts through point-of-care HbA1c testing, expanded access to registered dietitian, enhanced medication adherence programs, and team-based care that includes behavioral health support for lifestyle modification. The clinical leadership team continues to monitor diabetic control closely, with an emphasis on reducing the proportion of patients with HbA1c > 9% through coordinated care plans and continuous quality improvement initiatives.\n\n[TEXT] Controlling High Blood Pressure (BP < 140/90 mmHg). Between 2020 and 2024, the percentage of patients diagnosed with hypertension within the health center's patient population demonstrated some fluctuation but remained a significant focus area for chronic disease management. In 2020, nearly half (49.92%) of medical patients presented with hypertension. This proportion gradually declined through 2023, reaching a low of 40.02%, before increasing again to 46.19% in 2024.\n\n[TEXT] The total number of hypertension patients decreased from 6,344 in 2020 to 5,236 in 2023, followed by a modest increase to 5,464 in 2024. These changes may reflect several concurrent factors, including population shifts during the COVID-19 pandemic, enhanced screening and documentation processes, and expanded access to preventive and primary care services in subsequent years.\n\n[TEXT] In response to these trends, the health center has strengthened its chronic disease management program through improved care coordination, the use of evidence-based treatment protocols, and proactive patient engagement strategies such as follow-up calls, home blood pressure monitoring, and nutrition education. Continued emphasis on hypertension control remains a clinical quality priority, with a focus on reducing complications and improving overall cardiovascular health among the patient population.\n\n[TEXT] Between 2020 and 2024, the health center achieved a steady and significant improvement in hypertension control rates. In 2020, only 42.23% of patients with hypertension had controlled blood pressure. This measure increased each year, reaching 62.17% in 2024 - a 20-percentage point improvement over five years. The number of hypertensive patients with controlled blood pressure also grew from 2,679 in 2020 to 3,397 in 2024, reflecting enhanced chronic disease management and patient engagement.\n\n[TEXT] This sustained progress is attributed to the implementation of evidence-based hypertension protocols, proactive outreach by care coordinators, improved medication adherence through pharmacy collaboration, and expanded access to home BP monitoring. Additionally, the use of EHR-based alerts and population health dashboards allowed care teams to identify and intervene with patients whose blood pressure readings were trending upward.\n\n[TEXT] Advance Community Health, Inc.

Run a monthly report to identify patients with uncontrolled diabetes and hypertension who have not been to the clinic in the past 6 months with the goal of contacting those patients and bringing them back into the clinic.\n\n[TEXT] . Involving the whole team in the care of the patients (Nursing, APPs, Doctors, LCSWs, and Nutritionists) to help the patients improve their diabetes and hypertension.\n\n[TEXT] . Ensure that patients are being followed by the same primary care provider on their visits and that they are seen at least every 3 months until their diabetes and hypertension are well controlled.\n\n[HEADING] d. Screening for depression and follow-up planning, including depression remission.\n\n[TEXT] ACH supports a fully integrated model of primary and behavioral health care, wherein patients receive behavioral health screenings, appropriate referral to treatment, and ongoing support for the collaborative plan of care by medical providers. ACH uses the PHQ-2 or PHQ-9, GAD-7, PCL-PTSD, and Bio-Physical Assessments to screen patients for depression at intake. Staff enter results in the EHR, which are reviewed by the provider with referral for in-house or outside behavioral health services as indicated. Patients may be reluctant to complete depression screening or may not be truthful in responses due to the impact of stigma regarding mental health conditions. Providers will educate the patient regarding the benefits of screening and the health center's commitment to confidentiality.\n\n[TEXT] Depression Screening and Follow-Up Plan. From 2020 through 2024, the health center demonstrated consistent improvement in screening for depression and ensuring follow-up plans for patients with positive results. In 2020, 71.00% of patients were screened and had a documented follow-up plan when indicated. Despite a temporary decline in 2021 (57.28%), reflecting the operational disruptions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, performance rebounded in subsequent years, rising steadily to 74.94% in 2024. The number of patients screened increased significantly from 8,259 in 2020 to 11,513 in 2024, underscoring the center's success in integrating behavioral health services into primary care workflows.\n\n[TEXT] Behavioral health needs have increased sharply, particularly among adolescents and working-age adults. In response, ACH has expanded its integrated behavioral health model, embedding licensed clinicians within primary care teams to provide same-day consultations, brief therapy, and medication management. This co-located approach enhances early identification of behavioral health concerns and reduces stigma and delays in treatment.\n\n[TEXT] This improvement is attributed to the implementation of standardized screening tools (PHQ-2 and PHQ-9) within the EHR, provider training on behavioral health integration, and the availability of LCSWs across all service sites. The center also strengthened its referral pathways and documentation practices to ensure timely follow-up for patients with positive screens, particularly within the Health Care for the Homeless and high-risk populations.\n\n[TEXT] Depression Remission at Twelve Months. While year-to-year performance in depression remission varied, the data reflect ongoing progress toward achieving long-term behavioral health outcomes. After establishing baseline reporting in 2021 (11.05%), remission rates increased to 16.24% in 2023 before moderating to 10.04% in 2024.

The organization's emphasis on early detection, warm hand-offs, and consistent follow-up remains central to its strategy for improving depression remission and reducing the overall burden of behavioral health conditions within the patient population.\n\n[TEXT] ACH will improve clinical quality and health outcomes by:\n\n[TEXT] · Routine PHQ-2/PHQ-9 Screening: Embed depression screening in all adult and adolescent primary care visits using EMR prompts.\n\n[TEXT] · Warm Handoffs: Integrate behavioral health providers into primary care settings to ensure immediate follow-up for positive screenings.\n\n[TEXT] . Measuring Remission: Reassess PHQ-9 scores within 6-12 months to track improvement and remission rates, aligning with HRSA and UDS depression quality measures.\n\n[TEXT] . Provide staff with ongoing education on trauma-informed care, motivational interviewing, and suicide prevention protocols.\n\n[TEXT] People experiencing homelessness often face significant barriers to accessing behavioral health services, including the absence of family or social support networks that can assist them in seeking or maintaining care. To address these challenges, ACH employs LCSWs who rotate among all service sites to ensure consistent behavioral health access for all patients, including those served through the HCH program.\n\n[TEXT] ACH provides targeted support for homeless patients experiencing co-occurring substance use disorders. LCSWs work closely with medical providers to develop individualized, comprehensive plans of care that address both behavioral and physical health needs. Through this integrated approach, ACH ensures that vulnerable populations, particularly those experiencing homelessness, receive coordinated, patient- centered behavioral health services designed to promote stability, recovery, and improved quality of life.\n\n[HEADING] e. Tobacco use screening and cessation intervention.\n\n[TEXT] Tobacco use screening and cessation intervention. From 2020 through 2024, ACH consistently maintained high performance in screening adult patients for tobacco use and providing cessation interventions when indicated. In 2020, 96.15% of patients aged 12 and older were screened and counseled on tobacco use. Although there was a temporary decline in 2021 (82.62%) - largely due to pandemic- related disruptions and reduced in-person visits - performance steadily improved in the following years, reaching 91.52% in 2024.\n\n[TEXT] The total number of adult medical patients screened increased from 7,522 in 2020 to 9,733 in 2024, reflecting ACH's renewed focus on preventive health measures and robust documentation practices. The health center's providers integrate tobacco screening and cessation counseling into routine visits using standardized EHR prompts and evidence-based counseling protocols. Patients identified as tobacco users are offered immediate cessation support, including behavioral counseling, nicotine replacement therapy, and referral to the North Carolina Quitline.\n\n[TEXT] Advance Community Health, Inc.

Weight assessment and counseling for nutrition and physical activity for children and adolescents.\n\n[TEXT] Weight Assessment and Counseling for Nutrition and Physical Activity (Children and Adolescents, Ages 3-17). Between 2020 and 2024, ACH observed a gradual decline in the percentage of pediatric patients receiving weight assessment and counseling for nutrition and physical activity. In 2020, 79.32% of children and adolescents were assessed and counseled, compared to 51.94% in 2024. The number of patients receiving this service varied over the five-year period, peaking at 2,653 in 2023.\n\n[TEXT] This downward trend corresponds to several contributing factors, including the reduced frequency of in- person well-child visits during the pandemic and challenges in documenting counseling within the EHR. In response, ACH has implemented strategies to improve performance, including reinforcing documentation protocols, integrating nutrition and physical activity counseling prompts into visit templates, and expanding collaboration with registered dietitians and school-based health partners. These actions are designed to reestablish strong performance levels and promote early prevention of obesity and related chronic conditions among pediatric patients.\n\n[TEXT] ACH will improve clinical quality and health outcomes by:\n\n[TEXT] · Routine Documentation: Record height, weight, and BMI percentile for all patients ages 3 to 17 at each well-child and acute care visit.\n\n[TEXT] · Preventive Counseling: Provide age-appropriate counseling on nutrition and physical activity for children and their caregivers, documented within the EMR.\n\n[TEXT] . Ensure appropriate laboratory testing and referral to Nutrition and Behavioral health for children and adolescents who are underweight/overweight.\n\n[TEXT] ACH will continue to advance clinical quality and health outcomes by implementing evidence-based practices, strengthening care coordination, and focusing on prevention, early detection, and effective management of chronic and behavioral health conditions.\n\n[TEXT] GOVERNANCE\n\n[TEXT] Advance Community Health, Inc.

ACH has structured its operating model to scale efficiently and sustainably within the SAAT-announced funding level by leveraging existing infrastructure, cross-trained staff, and collaborative partnerships. Projected growth in patient volume will result from optimized scheduling, enhanced care coordination, and the continued integration of quality improvement initiatives that strengthen access and patient outcomes.\n\n[TEXT] The proportion of federal funds requested is appropriate and aligned with ACH's payer mix and the high proportion of uninsured and underinsured patients across the Wake and Franklin County service area, including Health Care for the Homeless patients. ACH operates a high-value, patient-centered delivery system that remains the region's primary safety net provider. The proposed budget represents a balanced and sustainable financial plan in which projected expenses do not exceed anticipated revenues from program income, grants, and other funding sources. Federal support per patient remains reasonable and justified given the area's substantial unmet needs, the breadth of services provided, and the investments required to maintain equitable access for diverse and underserved populations.\n\n[TEXT] The plan reflects sound financial stewardship consistent with HRSA's Financial Management and Accounting Systems requirements (45 CFR Part 75 Subpart D; Compliance Manual Ch. 15). Federal funds are dedicated to allowable costs that directly support the approved scope of services and expected patient increases. ACH's internal controls, procurement, and reporting systems ensure funds are managed responsibly and in full compliance with Uniform Guidance. Budgets are reviewed monthly by the CFO, CEO, leadership team, and Board of Trustees to verify alignment between expenditures, performance, patient growth, and quality metrics.\n\n[TEXT] ACH continues to implement organization-wide efficiency measures, such as participation in group purchasing organizations, negotiated vendor and service contracts, and centralized procurement and inventory controls under 45 CFR §§ 75.326 -. 335 - ensuring every federal dollar achieves maximum community benefit. ACH also maximizes reimbursement from Medicaid, Medicare, and other third-party sources while maintaining full compliance with HRSA's Sliding Fee Discount Program to guarantee that care remains accessible regardless of ability to pay.\n\n[TEXT] For more than half a century (53-years) of exceptional service and measurable community health gains, ACH remains the region's most effective mechanism for addressing persistent gaps in medical, dental, and behavioral health/substance use care.

Non-Profit 501(c)(3) Corporation\n\n[TEXT] The Mission of Advance Community Health Inc. (the \"Corporation\") is to deliver quality, compassionate primary healthcare - every patient, every time - in response to the needs of our communities. The Corporation provides services primarily to residents of Wake and Franklin counties; however, the Corporation cares for all, regardless of insurance status or ability to pay.\n\n[HEADING] ARTICLE I. OFFICES\n\n[TEXT] The Corporation may have such offices as the Board of Trustees may determine or as the affairs of the Corporation may require from time to time.\n\n[HEADING] ARTICLE II. BOARD OF TRUSTEES\n\n[TEXT] Section 1. General Powers. The Corporation is organized pursuant to North Carolina General Statutes, Chapter 55A (Nonprofit Corporation Act), and the affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by the Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees shall, always, ensure that the Corporation operates in compliance with the laws of the State of North Carolina and with the federal rules and regulations that govern the funding and operation of community health centers. The Board of Trustees shall always reserve full authority. No individual, entity or committee, at any time, has approval or veto authority over the Board. The Board of Trustees shall operate in concert with the organization's fiscal year (April 1 - March 31).\n\n[TEXT] Section 2. Number and Qualifications. The Corporation shall have two categories of Trustees, \"patients\" and \"non-patients.\" The definition of \"patient\" includes any person (or their parent/legal guardian) who has utilized the Corporation as their principal source of primary or dental care within the last two years. A non-patient shall be defined as a representative of the community in the Corporation's service area.\n\n[TEXT] The Board of Trustees shall be a self-perpetuating body with vacancies being filled by a majority vote of the members present at a duly constituted meeting of the Board of Trustees. At least fifty- one percent (51%) of board members shall be patients who shall be representative of the Corporation's patient demographics in terms of age, race, ethnicity and gender.

Advance Community Health provides high-quality healthcare services that include primary care, substance use care, dental care, as well as case management and health education. Because of the high prevalence of poverty in our area, these services are critical to meeting the healthcare needs of the population.

Together with other community partner organizations, Advance Community Health plays a key part in improving the health, well-being, and overall quality of life for area residents.\n\n[TEXT] LCHC considers Advance Community Health's provision of affordable healthcare services as invaluable to the region, and we look forward to continuing our collaboration.

Each community organization has its role, and that shared responsibility and willingness to work together has served to improve the overall wellbeing of the population. Advance's role in particular has improved the health of residents through the provision not only of primary care, but also preventative screenings, health education and the promotion of a healthy lifestyle. By improving the daily health of residents, Advance lowers the risk of complications of serious, often life-threatening diseases and therefore reduces the need for and cost of providing acute care - a valuable service for the community as a whole but especially for the uninsured and low-income residents otherwise unable to afford medical care.\n\n[TEXT] Piedmont Health is proud to continue sharing this responsibility through an ongoing mutual referral relationship with Advance and through continued collaboration in identifying and meeting local needs.

By improving the daily health of residents, Advance Community Health lowers the risk of complications from serious, often life-threatening diseases and therefore reduces the need for and cost of providing acute care -- a valuable service for the community as a whole but especially for uninsured and low-income residents otherwise unable to afford medical care.\n\n[TEXT] UNC Health Rex is proud to continue sharing this responsibility through an ongoing mutual referral relationship with Advance Community Health and through continued collaboration in identifying and meeting local needs.\n\n[TEXT] As such, UNC Health Rex believes that provision of Section 330 funding to Advance Community Health will have a positive impact on our community. These funds will ensure the continued access to comprehensive, primary care services for the low-income and uninsured residents of Wake and Franklin counties and will strengthen not only Advance Community Health but the community as a whole.\n\n[TEXT] Sincerely,7\n\n[TEXT] Chad Setliff President\n\n[TEXT] Advance Community Health, Inc.

Definitions of income and family. Alignment with the current FPG. Methods for assessing all patients for sliding fee discount eligibility based only on income and family size. Assurance that patient charges are adjusted based on ability to pay and consistent with the SFDS. Policies related to nominal charges for patients with incomes at or below 100 percent of the current FPG.\n\n[TEXT] How you assess all patients for sliding fee discount eligibility based only on income and family size. See income definition in Chapter 9: Sliding Fee Discount Program of the Compliance Manual.\n\n[TEXT] ACH provides services according to a Board approved SFDP based solely on income and family size, consistent with Chapter 9 of HRSA's Compliance Manual. The SFDS applies to patients with incomes up to 200% of the FPG.\n\n[TEXT] ACH utilizes written policies and procedures to implement the SFDS. These policies and procedures define income and family size, specify documentation or verification requirements for determining and recording family size and income, detail the specific structure for the SFDS itself, establish the frequency for re-evaluation of patient eligibility, and address provisions for waiving fees and nominal charges for specific patient circumstances.\n\n[TEXT] Family size and income are verified using official documentation to determine wages and salary, excluding assets and other similar items, consistent with HRSA definitions. These figures are compared to the annually published FPG. ACH follows HRSA's definition of \"family,\" which is a group of two or more persons related by birth, marriage, or adoption who live together; all such related persons are considered members of one family.\n\n[TEXT] Eligibility determinations are conducted respectfully, confidentially, and in a culturally appropriate manner to avoid barriers to care. Acceptable income documentation includes recent pay stubs, tax returns, or other verifiable proof of earnings; assets are not considered.\n\n[TEXT] All patients are made aware of the SFDP via the Patient Registration Form, which is completed by all new patients, and updated annually. Signs in multiple languages are posted near the front desk area of all locations providing information about the SFDP. When patients inquire about or are invited to apply for the Sliding Fee Discount Program, front-office staff and Patient Financial Navigators provide assistance with completing the application. Applications are reviewed and updated annually, or sooner if there is a change in household income or size. For patients who are unemployed, report zero income, or are homeless or transitioning from homelessness, eligibility is re-evaluated every six months to ensure continued accuracy.\n\n[TEXT] Advance Community Health, Inc.

Per guidance, an individual may be considered homeless if they are \"doubled up\" with others, or if they are a previously homeless person being discharged from a hospital, prison, or similar institution without stable housing to return to. All patients who identify as homeless, regardless of insurance status, must provide documentation of their homeless status consistent with this definition. Acceptable documentation includes a certification letter from a shelter or social service agency or correlating verification forms such as household instability or \"doubled-up\" documentation. This documentation is attached to the patient's SFDP application to ensure eligibility determination aligns with HRSA requirements.\n\n[TEXT] ACH's Practice Management System calculates the percentage of FPG based on income and family size and flags records for review. Eligibility is re-verified annually, and the Chief Financial Officer and Practice Managers audit files to ensure accuracy and adherence to policy.\n\n[TEXT] How you adjust patient charges based on the ability to pay. ACH adjusts patient charges based on ability to pay through its Board-approved SFDP. Discounts are applied using a SFDS aligned with the most recent FPG and determined by verified household income and family size.\n\n[TEXT] The SFDP applies to all individuals and families with annual incomes between 100% and 200% of the FPG. Discounts (flat or percentage-based) are applied consistently across all service types, including medical, behavioral health, dental, nursing, nutrition, pharmacy, urgent care, integrated care, and OB/GYN.\n\n[TEXT] Patients with annual incomes at or below 100% of the FPG are charged only a nominal fee, while those between 101% and 200% of the FPG receive graduated discounts. The SFDS includes four pay classes above 100% FPG - 101-125%, 126-150%, 151-175%, and 176-200%. No sliding fee discount is approved for individuals or families with incomes exceeding 200% of the FPG.\n\n[TEXT] All services are billed at their full established charge, and discounts are applied according to each patient's verified eligibility level. Uninsured patients and those who are underinsured (with self-pay balances such as co-payments or deductibles) are encouraged to apply for the SFDP.\n\n[TEXT] Eligibility is determined and documented annually, based on verification of income and household size, and reassessed whenever a change in financial circumstances occurs. ACH ensures that no patient is denied care due to inability to pay, thereby maintaining equitable access to all health center services.\n\n[TEXT] Each year, the Board of Trustees, comprised of a patient-majority membership, reviews and approves the SFDS to incorporate the most recent FPG. As part of this review, the Board evaluates the structure and effectiveness of the discount schedule to ensure it continues to reduce financial barriers to care. This includes reviewing UDS data, practice management system financial reports, and patient\n\n[TEXT] Advance Community Health, Inc.

ACH applies a nominal flat fee for patients with incomes at or below 100% of the FPG and does not reflect the cost of the service provided. The nominal fee is intended solely to encourage shared responsibility and not to create a financial barrier to care. Examples (effective 05/01/2025-03/31/2026) include: $40 for medical or behavioral health visits; $60 for dental visits; $10 for nurse visits; $17 for nutrition services; $10.50 for pharmacy dispensing; $125 for urgent care visits; $75 for integrated care visits; and Fee per procedure for OB/GYN.\n\n[HEADING] Key Management Staff\n\n[TEXT] Compliant; Required Attachments and Forms: Attachment 4: Position Descriptions for Key Management Staff, Form 2: Staffing Profile, Attachment 3: Project Organizational Chart, Attachment 4: Position Descriptions for Key Management Staff\n\n[TEXT] Compliance Narrative:\n\n[TEXT] No narrative required beyond the narrative included in the attachments and forms.\n\n[HEADING] Contracts and Subawards\n\n[TEXT] Compliant; Required Attachments and Forms: Attachment 7: Summary of Contracts, Agreements, Form 8: Health Center Agreements\n\n[HEADING] Compliance Narrative:\n\n[TEXT] Describe your oversight of all contracts and subawards to ensure:\n\n[TEXT] · The applicability of all Health Center Program requirements to the subrecipient.\n\n[TEXT] · The applicability to the subrecipient of any distinct statutory, regulatory, and policy requirements of other Federal programs associated with their HRSA- approved scope of project.
