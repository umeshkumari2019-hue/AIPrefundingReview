The needs assessment utilizes the most recently available data for the service area and, if applicable, special populations and addresses the following:",
          "evidence": "In the Project Narrative, under 'Need' and specifically section 5a, the application states: 'DFDRMC, as part of the Central Maine ACO, participates in the Maine Shared Community Health Needs Assessment (MSCHNA) that is performed every 3 years. This data and collection of community feedback helps set the priorities for state-wide service delivery and specifically for DFDRMC focus areas - such as the expansion of behavioral health and substance use services.' The narrative also details annual reviews of UDS data and UDS Mapper, and references the use of the 2024 UDS report and the 2025 Maine Shared Community Health Needs Assessment. The application describes how the needs assessment is used to inform service delivery, including expansion of services and adjustment of the Scope of Project. The needs assessment addresses population demographics, health status, barriers to care, and service area changes, and uses the most recent data available.",

          "reasoning": "The application clearly documents that a comprehensive needs assessment is completed at least every three years (via participation in the MSCHNA), and that annual reviews of UDS and UDS Mapper data are conducted to monitor patient origin and identify gaps in service. The application references the use of the most recent available data (2024 UDS, 2025 MSCHNA, current census and state data). The needs assessment is used to inform service delivery, expansion, and strategic planning, as required. There is sufficient evidence that the health center meets the requirement to complete or update a needs assessment at least every three years, using current data, and that the assessment informs and improves service delivery.",
