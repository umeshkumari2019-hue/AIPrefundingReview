          "evidence": "1. The Project Narrative (NEED section) states: 'The Educational Health Center of Wyoming conducts its need assessment annually at the beginning of the fiscal year.'\n2. The needs assessment uses most recently available data: population estimates for 2025, 2020, and 2010; poverty and unemployment statistics for July 2025; median household income for 2024; race and ethnicity data; and references to the 2021 UDS Report.\n3. The needs assessment addresses factors associated with access to care (geography, transportation, income, education, etc.), significant causes of morbidity and mortality (chronic disease prevalence, payor mix, uninsured rates), and other unique needs (homelessness, Medicaid expansion status, cultural barriers, etc.).\n4. The application describes how the results are used to inform and improve service delivery: 'Many factors inform and help the EHCW to improve its service delivery. These factors include residents living in more geographically isolated areas that require long travel times to the nearest primary care provider; low educational attainment levels; low median household income and income levels.'\n5. The HRSA Site Visit Report (TA010737) states under Needs Assessment: 'Overall Compliance: Yes' and specifically for Element b: 'Does the health center complete or update a needs assessment of the current population at least once every 3 years? [X]: Yes' and 'Is the needs assessment based on the most recently available data for the service area and, if applicable, special populations? [X]: Yes'.\n6. The Site Visit Report also confirms: 'Does the needs assessment address all of the following: ... [X]: Yes' and 'Did the health center provide at least one example of how it used the results of its needs assessment to inform and improve the delivery of health center services? [X]: Yes'.",
