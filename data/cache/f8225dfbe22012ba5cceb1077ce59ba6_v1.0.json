The Budget Narrative and Form 3 provide breakdowns by payer (Medicaid, Medicare, Private, Self-Pay) and by other funding sources. The Budget Narrative states: 'TOTAL REVENUE: $2,975,904 (Federal) + $9,783,032 (Non-Federal) = $12,758,936.'

The Compliance Narrative (Attachment 13) also directly addresses this, referencing the same Bylaws language and confirming no agreements or collaborations restrict board authority.
