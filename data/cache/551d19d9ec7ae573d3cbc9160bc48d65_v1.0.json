Each CHNA incorporates input from public health experts, thousands of area residents and dozens of community organizations through central Pennsylvania to identify the community's more pressing health needs... Hamilton also independently hires Capital Link to conduct a more granular assessment specific to the zip-codes within Hamilton's service area. This multi-modal, comprehensive needs assessment also occurs every three years.' Additionally, the narrative references the use of the most recent UDS data (2024), county health rankings, public health surveillance data, and community health assessments.
