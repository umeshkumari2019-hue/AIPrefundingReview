A review of the top needs identified in Ashtabula, Cuyahoga, and Lake County's most recently published community health needs assessments. 3. Two electronic surveys of more than 1,000 SHI patients and 250 low-income individuals in the service area to identify health priorities, unmet needs, and service preferences. 4. Listening sessions with more than 100 clinical staff members about barriers to care and needed healthcare services. 5. A survey of agencies and other healthcare providers that refer their clients to SHI.' The CHNA was presented to SHI's Board of Directors at their September 2025 meeting. The application also describes annual reviews of service area boundaries and interim updates to the CHNA as needed. The needs assessment references use of recent data (2025 CHNA, 2022-2024 county CHNAs, 2024 UDS data, etc.) and is used to inform service delivery, expansion, and strategic planning.",
