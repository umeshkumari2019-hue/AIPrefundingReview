For the last 34 years, the Network was an FQHC under Resources for Human Development (previous Grant No. H80CS00718). That organization changed ownership and relinquished the grant on 6/30/25. The health center has established the new FPCSN non-profit corporation, which meets all of the requirements of the HRSA Health Center Program, and is now applying as a new applicant for the area it has served for many years. This application is being submitted to ensure that patients continue to have access to the vital services FPCSN provides.FPCSN serves a large part of urban Philadelphia, where the residents are largely Black/African American (54.2%) and low income (49.6% under 200% of poverty). The community needs assessment shows significant disparities in access to health care and the health of residents, compared to the state. The target population has high levels of chronic illness, significant barriers to adequate health care, and a lack of culturally appropriate and accessible services. Much of the service area is designated as Medically Underserved Areas and as Dental Health Professional Shortage Areas. FPCSN collaborates with the Philadelphia Housing Authority and Department of Public Health and a number of local and state organizations, including the Pennsylvania Association of Community Health Centers. The Network includes three full comprehensive service sites: Abbottsford/Falls, the Health Annex, and the Stephen and Sandra Sheller 11th Street Family Health Services and six school-based sites. The Network's sites have all been developed in collaboration with public housing residents who are the target of services. FPCSN served 15,617 people in 2024, an increase from 15,214 in 2023 and 14,872 in 2022. One FPCSN site has Patient-Centered Medical Home recognition.FPCSN health center sites will continue to provide the full range of primary and preventive FQHSC services, including pre-natal, obstetric, and midwifery services; diabetes and nutrition education; podiatry, pharmacy; and case management. FPCSN provides behavioral health services and has been a leader in the integration of behavioral health with primary care. Medication for Opioid Use Disorder services began in 2018. A full range of oral health services is provided and accessible to all patients. In recent years, in recognition of the trauma and stress experienced by patients and staff, the health centers have added complementary wellness services, including mind/body care such as yoga, acupuncture, and massage. A longstanding continuous quality improvement system and a fully certified EHR assure quality services and efficiency. The FPSCN Board meets 330 requirements and is vested with full authority and responsibility for the operations of the FPCSN Health Center. The Board includes one member who is a representative of the Housing Authority and two others who are or have been public housing residents. FPCSN is working to increase the number of patients served, but is now planning to serve at least 15,617 patients in the 2026 calendar year.\n\n[TEXT] Funding Opportunity Number: HRSA-26-004 Received

(FPCSN or the Network) is submitting this Service Area Competition New application to continue health care services to residents of public housing and surrounding underserved Philadelphia, Pennsylvania communities. For the last 33 years, the Network was an FQHC under Resources for Human Development. That organization changed ownership and relinquished the grant on 6/30/25. The FPCSN health center has established the new non-profit FPCSN corporation, registered in Pennsylvania and with the IRS, that meets all of the requirements of the HRSA Health Center Program. The area served includes large parts of urban Philadelphia that have concentrations of public housing. The FPCSN health center includes three comprehensive service sites: Abbottsford/Falls, the Health Annex, and the Stephen and Sandra Sheller 11th Street Family Health Services of Drexel University, as well as six school-based sites. FPCSN is the largest nurse-led health center network in the country, and one of the oldest. Over its long history, FPCSN has used an integrated model to deliver primary care provided by nurse practitioner, behavioral health, dental, and preventive services providers. The FPCSN model is a psychosocial, interdisciplinary approach that \"wraps its arms\" around patients. The FPCSN Board meets all 330 requirements.\n\n[HEADING] NEED\n\n[HEADING] 1. Service Area and Assessment of Community Served\n\n[HEADING] a. Service Area Boundaries\n\n[TEXT] The FPCSN service area includes 25 Zip Codes in Philadelphia City/County and four adjacent Delaware County Zip Codes where residents are largely low-income minorities. Almost all of the service area in Philadelphia is designated as Medically Underserved Area (#02920, 21, 22, 23; #02947 and 51; #03022, 23, and 25; and #04060)1. Most of the service area in Philadelphia is also designated as Dental Health Professional Shortage Area (Low income (#6426206525, #6421164833, #6428506949, and #6427043664)2,3. The GeoCare Navigator map document included in this application (Attachment 1) shows the Zip Codes (gray area) in the service area, the MUAs to be served (orange areas), and the area FQHC sites and hospitals4. The required map, legend, and table are included, as well as one map that shows the Dental HPSAs (purple area) and public housing and a second map that includes labels for the FPCSN sites and other FQHC sites and the hospitals serving the area.\n\n[HEADING] b. Location in an Opportunity Zone\n\n[TEXT] A number of the Census Tracts in the FPCSN service area in the Philadelphia and Delaware County area are designated as Opportunity Zones.

FPCSN health center locations are accessible to public housing developments, either by walking or by public transportation. Both Philadelphia and the nearest parts of Delaware County have extensive public transportation, including SouthEast Pennsylvania Transit Authority (SEPTA) subways, buses, trolleys, and regional rail, so most patients from the areas served are able to travel to FPCSN services, sometimes with assistance from the health center. Patients with mobility difficulties or who must bring children to appointments are assisted to access transportation operated by their insurer or provided transportation directly using the FPCSN vans.\n\n[HEADING] d. Overlap and Access to Primary Health Care Services\n\n[TEXT] FPCSN has grown and developed over many years in response to need and demand in the communities served, particularly the public housing communities. The Network collaborates with the Philadelphia Housing Authority (PHA) to ensure that public housing residents are aware of the health center's services and to identify residents who are interested in working with the health center. In 2023, HUD awarded Philadelphia a Choice Neighborhoods Initiative (CNI) implementation grant to expand the Bartram Village development in Southwest Philadelphia. FPCSN was a partner in that project, providing health care, prenatal care, cancer screening, connection with services, training, and programming in the development. The FPCSN service area boundaries overlap those of seven of Philadelphia's 13 Health Planning Districts and the health center has always worked closely with the City Department of Public Health. Both organizations have also worked with the Promise Zone that has existed within the service area in West Philadelphia since 2014. In recent years, FPCSN has worked with the Philadelphia School District, which includes the entire City. The health center is registered as a provider with the School District and currently has six school-based health center sites in area schools. Delaware County is a suburban county that, as a whole, is very wealthy with a number of school districts across the county. However, the areas bordering Philadelphia have high levels of poverty and low penetration by FQHCs. Because there is only one FQHC that has locations in Delaware County that serve the general public and a number of hospitals have closed in recent years, many people from those bordering areas travel into Philadelphia for primary care.\n\n[HEADING] e. Service Area Review\n\n[TEXT] It is FPCSN policy that, as part of the process of needs assessment and strategic planning and review, management and the Board complete an annual review of the UDS report for previous years, including the Zip Codes in which patients reside. Recent reviews found that 84.6% of the 15,214 patients served in 2023 and 84.0% of the 15,617 patients served in 2024 resided in the Zip Codes noted on Form 5B, percentages that are higher than the 75% required. The annual review of patient origin information is used to identify any new areas where people are coming from for care. The health center then reviews need and resources in those areas and may add Zip Codes to the scope and work to increase relationships and outreach where services are needed.\n\n[HEADING] f.

Area Changes Since Last SAC Application\n\n[TEXT] The service area 154 *** noted on the SAC SAAT is the area that has been served by the health center now known as FPCSN for many years. The previous awardee was Resources for Human Development and the health center was a program of that organization until its ownership\n\n[TEXT] 2\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 13 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 242645\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: N/A\n\n[HEADING] Family Practice & Counseling Services Network 2026 Service Area Competition Application\n\n[TEXT] changed and it relinquished the grant on 6/30/2025. The health center has established the new non-profit FPCSN corporation and is required to apply for this service area as a New Applicant. However, because of its long history in serving this area as an FQHC, FPCSN is going to answer the questions for Competing Continuation Applicants as well as those for New Applicants.\n\n[TEXT] The last SAC application for this service area submitted by the health center under the previous awardee was completed in October, 2024 for the 2025-28 period. There have been no significant changes to the service area, as can be noted by the fact that 84.6% of the 15,214 patients served in 2023 and 84.0% of the 15,617 patients served in 2024 resided in the service area Zip Codes listed on the SAAT and noted in Form 5B for the previous awardee and for this application. A change that is taking place among FPCSN patients and the service area alike is that an increasing number of patients do not have insurance coverage for their care and decreasing numbers are covered by Medicaid.\n\n[HEADING] 2. Health Care Needs of the Service Area/Population\n\n[TEXT] The 2023 US Census6 indicates that there are 1,016,690 people living in the FPCSN service area. The population has a level of poverty that is almost two and a half times that of the state and more than twice the percentages of children and elderly living in poverty than the state. In spite of ongoing efforts to reduce the number of people who lack health insurance and the expansion of Medicaid, the level of the uninsured population in the target communities is significantly higher than that of the state.\n\n[TEXT] Service Area\n\n[TEXT] Pennsylvania\n\n[TEXT] % of population below 100% of Poverty\n\n[TEXT] 26.7%\n\n[TEXT] 11.8%\n\n[TEXT] % of population below 200% of poverty\n\n[TEXT] 48.2%\n\n[TEXT] 26.8%\n\n[TEXT] % of children under 18 living in poverty\n\n[TEXT] 36.1%\n\n[TEXT] 16.0%\n\n[TEXT] Number of children under 18 living in poverty\n\n[TEXT] 81,039\n\n[TEXT] % of people 65+ living in poverty\n\n[TEXT] 24.8%\n\n[TEXT] 9.4%\n\n[TEXT] Number of people 65+ living in poverty\n\n[TEXT] 31,538\n\n[TEXT] % of population uninsured\n\n[TEXT] 7.5%\n\n[TEXT] 5.6%\n\n[TEXT] Barriers that impact the service area population's access to healthcare, in addition to poverty, include a lower level of education and a higher rate of unemployment than the state.

U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data indicate the average rate of unemployment in the state was 3.6% in 2024, but an estimate can be made for the area of a 5.3% unemployment rate based on extrapolation by the demographic makeup of the population7.\n\n[HEADING] Health Conditions in the Service Area\n\n[TEXT] The 2024 United Health Foundation America's Health Rankings report ranked Pennsylvania 23rd in overall health in the nation, with relatively high rates of drug deaths, air pollution, smoking, preventable hospitalizations, and cancer and cardiovascular death, as well as low public health\n\n[TEXT] 6 US Census Bureau, https://data.census.gov/cedsci/advanced, obtained July 2025\n\n[TEXT] 7 US Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, https://www.bls.gov/lau/ex14tables.htm, obtained July 2025.\n\n[TEXT] 3\n\n[TABLE] Table 2:\n | Service Area | Pennsylvania\n% of population below 100% of Poverty | 26.7% | 11.8%\n% of population below 200% of poverty | 48.2% | 26.8%\n% of children under 18 living in poverty | 36.1% | 16.0%\nNumber of children under 18 living in poverty | 81,039 | \n% of people 65+ living in poverty | 24.8% | 9.4%\nNumber of people 65+ living in poverty | 31,538 | \n% of population uninsured | 7.5% | 5.6%\n\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 14 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 242645\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: N/A\n\n[HEADING] Family Practice & Counseling Services Network 2026 Service Area Competition Application\n\n[TEXT] funding. The state ranks 42nd in drug deaths among women and 43rd in children with asthma8. The Annie E.

Philadelphia is the second poorest of the largest cities in America, with almost a quarter of residents and a third of children living below federal poverty level.

A study of Maternal Mortality found that Philadelphia's rate of pregnancy-related deaths was 15% higher than the national rate. Deaths due to accidental drug overdoses increased from 25% of Philadelphia's pregnancy-associated deaths (2010-16) to 39% (2017-18)16, which a City report traced to lack of access in healthcare and social service resources available to prenatal and postpartum women, complications in coordination of care, and behavioral health problems, including mental illness and drug abuse. The FPCSN service area population experiences disproportionately poor health outcomes as compared to the state in the areas of infant mortality, low birth weight, prenatal care, and breastfeeding initiation, which subsequently impact the overall health, including cognitive and behavioral development of young children. Pennsylvania health statistics extrapolated for the service area indicate the percentage of births to women who did not receive prenatal care in the first trimester of their pregnancies was 38.8%, significantly higher than the state rate of 27.5%, and 5.6% of births were to teen mothers, compared to 3.3%. There were 12.1% of babies in the service area born at a low birth weight and the infant mortality rate was 8.1/1,000 births, compared to state rates of 8.4% and 5.6/1,00017. Of the 12,794 mothers in the service area who gave birth in 2023, 59.4% were living below poverty, compared to 54.2% in the City and 37.7% in the state18.\n\n[HEADING] Behavioral Health\n\n[TEXT] The service area experiences higher levels of mental health problems than the state, with higher levels of reported poor mental health and depression. BRFSS data indicates that the percentage of adults reporting that their mental health was not good more than 14 days in the past month was 16.8% in the service area, compared to 14.9% in the state, and 23.3% indicated that they had at some point been diagnosed with a depressive disorder, compared to 21.7% in the state. Drug overdose/poisoning deaths are a serious problem in Pennsylvania and in Philadelphia, and the rates have been increasing tremendously. Philadelphia's fatal overdose rate was the second worst among the nation's large cities in 2020 and it doubled since 201419. The majority of individuals with a substance use disorder never access specialty substance use treatment20. Pennsylvania Health statistics indicate the rate of drug-induced mortality in Philadelphia in 2023 was still twice the rate in the state.\n\n[TEXT] Drug deaths/100,000\n\n[TEXT] Philadelphia\n\n[TEXT] Pennsylvania\n\n[TEXT] 2023\n\n[TEXT] 73.7\n\n[TEXT] 36.8\n\n[TEXT] 2022\n\n[TEXT] 79.0\n\n[TEXT] 40.7\n\n[TEXT] 2021\n\n[TEXT] 74.2\n\n[TEXT] 43.7\n\n[TEXT] 14 The Commonwealth Fund, Health and Health Care for Women of Reproductive Age, 2022, https://www. commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2022/apr/health-and-health-care-women-reproductive-age\n\n[TEXT] 15 KFF, 2024, https://www.kff.org/racial-equity-and-health-policy/issue-brief/racial-disparities-in-maternal-and- infant-health-current-status-and-efforts-to-address-them/\n\n[TEXT] 16 PA Maternal Mortality Review: 2021 Report Pennsylvania Department Of Health, Published January 2022\n\n[TEXT] 17 Pennsylvania Department of Health, ibid U.S. Census 2022 5 year estimates, ibid\n\n[TEXT] 19 Pew Charitable Trusts, Philadelphia's 2022, www.pewtrusts.org > assets > philadelphia-2022-the-state-of-the-city\n\n[TEXT] 20 City of Philadelphia, Mayor's Task Force to Combat the Opioid Epidemic, Report and Recommendations, https://dbhids.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/OTF_Report.pdf\n\n[TEXT] 5\n\n[TABLE] Table 4:\nDrug deaths/100,000 | Philadelphia | Pennsylvania\n2023 | 73.7 | 36.8\n2022 | 79.0 | 40.7\n2021 | 74.2 | 43.7\n\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 16 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 242645\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: N/A\n\n[HEADING] Family Practice & Counseling Services Network 2026 Service Area Competition Application\n\n[TEXT] It is estimated that about 26% of people in the country have an anxiety, mood, impulse control, and/or substance abuse disorder in a given year21. Studies indicate that more than half of the adult population has medical conditions and a quarter have mental health disorders and that medical conditions often overlap with mental health disorders22. The presence of multiple conditions complicates treatment, continuing care, and outcomes.\n\n[HEADING] Oral Health\n\n[TEXT] Pennsylvania has a number of issues related to oral health. Using extrapolation from the BRFSS and the Data Resource Center for Child and Adolescent Health, it can be estimated 36.1% of adults and 14.5% of children in the area received no dental care in the past year, compared to 32.3% and 15.6% for the state23,24. Access to affordable oral health services and anxiety are two significant reasons people do not receive dental care. Many people in the areas served reason to be apprehensive, given that they have received mostly emergency care, with long painful waits, treatment drawn out over a number of visits, and service at unfamiliar and unsatisfactory places. Financial barriers to dental care also have a negative impact. People who cannot afford care may wait until only extraction will resolve the problem or may choose extraction if it is the only alternative to the cost of a root canal, build-up, and crown. Many of the patients seen in the service area have limited education and understanding of the importance of oral health care.\n\n[HEADING] Health of Residents of Public Housing\n\n[TEXT] As noted above, FPCSN focuses its services on residents of public housing and the surrounding low-income areas. A study of people relocated as a result of the HOPE VI program25, which was designed to address problems in distressed public housing, indicated that the health of those in the mostly female HOPE VI sample has been significantly worse than the nation. Forty-one percent reported their health was \"fair or poor\", a rate three times that of US adults and about twice that of women nationally. The rates of the five most prevalent health problems: obesity, hypertension, diabetes, arthritis, and asthma, were significantly higher among the HOPE VI women. A follow up article26 indicated that the overall health of the HOPE VI women remained significantly poorer than that of adults and women nationally. Depression and stroke were added to the list of physical health problems experienced by the HOPE VI women at significantly higher rates than national prevalence rates.\n\n[HEADING] How Area Health Care Needs Are Being Met\n\n[TEXT] a.

Citywide, 85% of providers surveyed had an appointment available for a patient with private insurance and 66% had availability for a patient with Medicaid. The availability percentage for the West and Southwest Districts were 76% and 50%. Wait times for new patients were nine days for private pay and 16 days for those covered by Medicaid, the greatest disparity among the cities studied in the report. The recommendations in the report were that PDPH health systems and FQHCs locate primary care facilities in the noted underserved areas, including the areas that FPCSN serves.\n\n[TEXT] The Philadelphia service area has 14 FQHCs that have sites across the City and adjacent Delaware County, as well as eight FQHCs and Look-Alikes operated by the PDPH. (These numbers include FPCSN as it operated as part of RHD.) Even with all of these resources, only 38.7% of the low-income people in the FPCSN service area accessed FQHC services in 2023, leaving 298,589 low-income people unserved, including 43,404 uninsured people. In the Delaware County Zip Codes, the penetration rate was only 25.2%. All of the FQHCs and the City Health District Centers provide the full range of required primary and preventive services. Many of the FQHCs provide brief behavioral health services integrated with primary care, but only FPCSN and one other provide traditional outpatient BH services. Five of the FQHCs, including FPCSN and the City Centers, provide dental services as well. Only FPCSN and one other FQHC provide obstetric services directly. In the City Centers, patients experience great difficulty receiving care in a timely manner. Extrapolated data from the BRFSS survey28 indicate that 12.1% of service area adults do not have a personal health care provider, and 13.7% of adults needed to see a doctor in the last year but could not because of cost.\n\n[TEXT] In the greater Philadelphia area, fourteen hospitals have closed since 1992, nine in the past seven years, and 15 of Philadelphia's 19 obstetric units have closed since 1997, resulting in a reduction of more than 50% in the number of obstetric beds, and leaving most of these in the more affluent areas29. A hospital that served the nearby Delaware County Zip Codes closed this past spring. The City still has major hospitals remaining in the service area, including the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) Health System with its main hospitals in West Philadelphia, Roxborough Hospital, Temple University Hospital, and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and St. Christopher's Hospital for Children. All of these hospitals are non-profit institutions with trauma centers, specialty clinics, and inpatient services, pharmacy, x-ray and other ancillary services. FPCSN has an agreement for patient admissions with the Penn Hospital System and Penn Family Medicine, including contracts for prenatal and obstetric services that include admissions for deliveries. All of the hospitals have sliding scales available both in their inpatient and specialty services and FPCSN works with all of them.\n\n[TEXT] 27 Philadelphia Department of Public Health, Staying Health: Access to Primary Care in Philadelphia, November, 2018, https://www.phila.gov/media/20181109113640/2018-PrimaryCareReportFINAL.pdf\n\n[TEXT] 28 US DHHS, BRFSS, ibid\n\n[TEXT] 29 Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council, http://www.phc4.org/services/datarequests/ datausersseries/slorch-2013.htm\n\n[TEXT] 7\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 18 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 242645\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: N/A\n\n[HEADING] Family Practice & Counseling Services Network 2026 Service Area Competition Application\n\n[TEXT] Philadelphia has significant behavioral health resources. The service system for behavioral health and drug or alcohol services is organized around a public managed care organization, Community Behavioral Health (CBH), which contracts with the state Medicaid program to manage these services. The Department of Behavioral Health and Intellectual disAbility Services (DBHIDS) provides services to people with Medicaid and people who are uninsured through 11 community mental health centers, five crisis response centers, and 30 specialized BH providers, including FPCSN, that serve over 110,000 people annually. The Office of Addiction Services (OAS) contracts with community providers, including FPCSN, to provide prevention and treatment services that include outpatient treatment, detoxification, residential services, and case management, and serves about 24,000 people per year. There are a limited number of spaces available through these organizations for people without insurance, so the services provided by FPCSN and the other FQHCs that focus on low-income people are very important.\n\n[TEXT] Pennsylvania has 149 Dental Health Professional Shortage Areas, including four that almost cover Philadelphia, and the number of dental health professionals is expected to decrease in the coming years. With these shortages, only 48% of the oral health care needs of the population, and only 23% of dental practitioners participate in the Medicaid program, so many of those not receiving care are low-income people30. The reason there are such broad Dental HPSAs in the City is that many practices do not accept Medicaid and most do not have sliding scales for people with low income. So again, the services provided by FPCSN and the other FQHCs that focus on low-income people are very important.\n\n[TEXT] In-Scope Chronic Disease Management, Cancer Screening, Health Education, Nutrition - Many primary care practices that operate in the City and nearby Delaware County, including those operated by the health systems, the FQHCs, and private providers, provide comprehensive medical care that includes cancer screening and chronic disease management. What often is lacking in practices other than FPCSN and the other FQHCs is a broader view of health care and an awareness of the needs of lower income patients for preventive health education, nutrition information and assistance, and help to overcome barriers to health, such as food insecurity, housing instability, and financial strain. These issues of food/housing insecurity and financial issues need to take precedence before people can work on their health problems. Most health systems and private medical practices do not have these issues at the forefront of their work with patients and they also usually do not have mental health services integrated with primary care.\n\n[TEXT] Public Housing Residents Health Needs\n\n[TEXT] FPCSN has worked closely with the Philadelphia Housing Authority (PHA) in providing care and support for residents in public housing. Established in 1937, PHA is the nation's fourth largest public housing authority. It owns and operates more than 14,000 affordable housing units and serves more than 80,000 Philadelphians. The majority of PHA housing is in what is termed \"conventional\" public housing, that is, multi-family developments that may have anywhere from under 20 to several hundred units. PHA has moved away from conventional high-rise public housing to incorporate family, senior, and mixed developments that comprise about 7,600 of the units in the system. In addition, PHA is unique among housing authorities nationwide in that it also owns over 6,400 \"Scattered Site\" housing units that are located throughout Philadelphia.\n\n[TEXT] 30 Pennsylvania Department of Health, PA Oral Health Pla 2020-2030, https://paoralhealth.org/resource_type/ pennsylvania-department-of-health/\n\n[TEXT] 8\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 19 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 242645\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: N/A\n\n[HEADING] Family Practice & Counseling Services Network 2026 Service Area Competition Application\n\n[TEXT] PHA prides itself on the level of resident involvement in Philadelphia public housing. There are active Resident Councils, not only in the developments, but also for areas of scattered site housing. The Resident Councils are supported by Tenant Support Services, a subsidiary of PHA that is operated by tenants. Through a Resident Advisory Board that includes representatives of all of the Councils, residents participate actively in PHA policy development. Working with the Tenant Support Services, PHA publishes a quarterly newsletter that goes to all households, sponsors an online information portal for residents, and sponsors health fairs and a Food for Life fresh produce program. All of these initiatives can be vehicles that FPCSN is able to use to inform PHA residents of the services available.\n\n[TEXT] As noted above, the low-income populations who are residents of public housing have significant barriers to good health. PHA does not directly provide health services to residents of its public housing. One effect of the scattered site housing in Philadelphia is that those public housing residents are more difficult to reach than those in conventional developments. PHA refers people in need of health care to FPCSN, the Philadelphia Department of Public Health, and the other public housing FQHC. FPCSN is also the health partner for PHA for several of their recent federal projects with the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\n[TEXT] FPCSN's three comprehensive sites are located near and work with PHA developments. The Abbottsford Falls site serves Abbottsford Homes, the 11th Street site serves Richard Allen Homes as well as others, and the Health Annex serves Bartram Village. Each of these sites maintains an active Community Advisory Committee that includes members who are current or former public housing residents, which meet monthly and advise on clinic operations, patient experience, and emerging community needs. In collaboration with local Tenant Councils, the Abbottsford Falls and Bartram Village sites have provided mobile health, mind-body wellness offerings, perinatal health resources, and food pantry initiatives that strengthen local engagement and advance health access. At 11th Street, FPCSN partners with the Richard Allen community and the John F. Street Community Center on walking groups and cooking-based nutrition education with Vetri Community Partnership. To strengthen these collaborations, FPCSN has recruited a PHA representative to serve on its Board of Directors, ensuring resident perspectives help guide the Network's strategic trajectory and governance priorities.\n\n[TEXT] b/c. How Patient Support Services and Other Needs that Impact Health Status Are Being Met The population served by FPCSN is poor and has many health-related social needs. There are many people in the area who are food insecure; 15.8% of people and 30.9% of children in Philadelphia, compared to 8.9% and 13.1% for the state31. A Pew report found that 40% of all households and 88% of low-income households are housing cost-burdened - spending more than 30% of their income on housing32. A report by Community Legal Services found that the level of housing insecurity increased during the pandemic33. The situation is similar in Delaware County, where a family of four needs $97,000 to meet basic costs, the median income in the area served by FPCSN was $56,454, and 18.4% of households are housing cost-burdened, compared to\n\n[TEXT] 31 Philly Voice, Food Insecurity Increased in the Philly Region During the Covid-19 Pandemic,\n\n[TEXT] https://www.phillyvoice.com/food-insecurity-philadelphia-covid-19-pandemic-philabundance-feeding-america/ 32 The Pew Charitable Trusts, The State of Housing Affordability in Philadelphia, https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/ research-and-analysis/reports/2020/09/the-state-of-housing-affordability-in-philadelphia\n\n[TEXT] 33 Community Legal Services of Philadelphia, COVID-19's Impact on Race and Housing Security Across Philadelphia, https://clsphila.org/housing/report-philadelphia-renters/\n\n[TEXT] 9\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 20 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 242645\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: N/A\n\n[HEADING] Family Practice & Counseling Services Network 2026 Service Area Competition Application\n\n[TEXT] 15.8% for the County. The Foundation for Delaware County estimates that 12% of children and over 43,000 people overall are food insecure34. Again, other than FPCSN and the other FQHCs, there are few health services in the service area that take these things into consideration in the care they provide.\n\n[TEXT] People in the areas served not only require assistance with the barriers to health posed by food insecurity, housing insecurity, and financial strain. They also need health education, particularly to help them prevent and manage chronic illnesses, education about nutrition and how to prepare healthy food on a budget, and help to manage multiple health care providers and regimes. Care coordination services, such as those provided by FPCSN, are essential to supporting patients in understanding and finding ways to follow through with the care they need. Case management, care coordination, and assistance in the community are often necessary to help some people to maintain and manage their health. Other than FPCSN and the other FQHCs, almost no health services in the area have these kinds of services.\n\n[TEXT] The FPCSN population in Philadelphia has a number of problems traveling to medical services, even in a large city with a transportation system. The public transit system has recently made cuts to services that exacerbate these problems. The public transportation needed to reach health services can be costly and difficult for parents with several children or for elderly people. There are neighborhood-defining streets, railroad corridors, and rivers that act as de facto barriers, as well as dangerous areas through which women in particular do not wish to travel, especially with children. Many of the families served have a number of children, cannot afford child care, and must bring children to appointments, and many have significant health problems that limit their mobility. These same issues exist for the patients coming from Delaware County, which is served by the same public transit authority. It is essential that health providers assist patients with the cost of transportation or with other services to help them when needed. Few providers in the service area other than FPCSN and the other FQHCs do so.\n\n[HEADING] 3. Recent or Potential Changes in the Health Care Landscape\n\n[TEXT] The health care landscape in Southeastern Pennsylvania is changing quickly and dramatically. As more private equity has become part of health care, many hospitals have closed or become for-profit in recent years, including almost three quarters of the obstetric units in the area, leaving most of those remaining in the more affluent areas. Some patients have to travel significant distances to get to emergency care or to prenatal and obstetric services, which is particularly difficult for low-income patients. The Medicaid unwinding and further cuts that are possible will leave many of the people in the low-income population that FPCSN serves without access to health care coverage or with coverage that leaves them with high deductibles and co-pays. This will require FPCSN and all of the community health centers to provide assistance and the outreach and enrollment staff will be critical to health centers' ability to serve the community.\n\n[TEXT] FPCSN and the FQHCs are also working to adjust to the change to Value-based payment methodology and the focus on HEDIS measures. The population served experiences significant health problems and barriers to care and positive outcomes, making it challenging to adjust to outcomes-based payment mechanisms. The additional care coordination needed to manage in this\n\n[TEXT] 34 The Foundation for Delaware County, https://delcofoundation.org/our-impact/priority-areas/food-security/\n\n[TEXT] 10\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 21 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 242645\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: N/A\n\n[HEADING] Family Practice & Counseling Services Network 2026 Service Area Competition Application\n\n[TEXT] system will benefit the patients that FPCSN serves. However, an increase in staffing is necessary to be successful at value-based care and that is a barrier to implementation of this methodology. FPCSN has joined its first Accountable Care Organization, a small ACO focused on Medicare patients, as it works to build the necessary infrastructure to work in the new environment.\n\n[TEXT] Another payment change the center is working to adjust to is the restrictions the pharmaceutical companies are putting on discounts on drugs distributed through contracted pharmacies, as well as the increasing reporting that is being required. FPCSN has made adjustments to manage the restrictions, but the administrative tasks again require added staffing. The revenue generated in the 340b program goes back into health center to support services, particularly enabling services, so reductions in this revenue have an impact on the services available to patients. On the positive side, the addition of enhanced payments to FQHCs for long-acting reversible contraception will increase the health center's capacity to provide these to patients.\n\n[TEXT] FPCSN continues to adapt to a dynamic health care environment shaped by pending changes to ensure access to primary care, behavioral health, and enabling services across its service area. Guided by its Strategic Plan and Continuous Quality Improvement Plan, FPCSN is preparing to align its operations with these changes by strengthening community partnerships and integrating social support services into care delivery.\n\n[HEADING] 4. How Projected Numbers of Patients were Determined\n\n[TEXT] a/b. Unduplicated Patients and Patients by Type of Service Expected to be Served in 2026 The health center served 14,872 unduplicated patients in 2022, 15,214 patients in 2023, and 15,617 patients in 2024. FPCSN's continuing services and projects will serve at least 15,617 patients by the close of 2026, the same as the Patient Target advertised in the SAAT, and has used that number in the process of developing the budget and Form 1A. This unduplicated number of patients to be served includes 12,839 patients provided with 41,085 medical visits, 3,966 patients provided with 31,339 mental health visits, 78 patients provided with 174 substance abuse services, 3,569 patients provided with 8,208 dental visits and 4,300 patients provided with 7,375 enabling visits. Although FPCSN expects to be able to serve the target number of patients overall, there may be fewer patients served in dental and behavioral health services as staff need to be hired in those departments. The health center will be continuing to work to serve more patients as it is clear that the need in the Philadelphia area is tremendous.\n\n[HEADING] 5. Community Needs Assessment and Input\n\n[HEADING] a. How Area Needs will be Assessed and Updated\n\n[TEXT] FPCSN policy requires that an assessment of the needs of the target population and the service area communities will be conducted at least every three years and will be used by management and the Board for strategic planning. The needs assessment is to include information from the Census, state and local studies, statistical analysis, and information obtained through the relationships the health center and its Board members have in the community served. The needs assessment process also uses information from FPCSN's performance improvement activities, which includes utilization and outcomes data, risk management and incident information, and patient satisfaction surveys and surveys of and visioning sessions with staff about whether patient needs are being met and any suggestions about how services can be improved.\n\n[TEXT] 11\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 22 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 242645\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: N/A\n\n[HEADING] Family Practice & Counseling Services Network 2026 Service Area Competition Application\n\n[HEADING] b. How the Scope of Project will be Updated as Needed\n\n[TEXT] Any information that comes from the needs assessment process or from patient or community satisfaction surveys regarding a need for services that are lacking in the service area will be investigated and, in some cases, responded to with new services being initiated and added to the Scope of Project. Likewise, the assessment of patient origins conducted each year, as noted above, may find that a significant number of patients are coming from an area not in scope and this may result in an analysis of that area and why the change and influx might be taking place. In some cases, this may result in a Scope of Project update to add new areas.\n\n[TEXT] c. How Patient and Community Input will Inform and Improve Service Delivery\n\n[TEXT] The goal of FPCSN's needs assessment and quality improvement activities is to continuously improve services and assure that they are meeting the needs of the service area and the target population. Information about patients' use of health center services and what else they need is gathered through patient satisfaction surveys and sometimes through focus groups as well. Staff opinions are also surveys as they have close contact with patients and know their needs. The patient members on Board share their experiences and opinions as well. In addition, each of the comprehensive health center sites has a Community Advisory Committee made up of people from the area surrounding the site, some of whom live in public housing, the mission of which is to help the site understand the needs and opinions of the community. Finally, FPCSN collaborates with community organizations, such as the FQHCs and the Pennsylvania Association of Community Health Centers, the hospitals, and the Public Housing Authority and the School District, to assure that pertinent information is gathered regarding the health care landscape, needs of the community, and opinion regarding the work of the health center.\n\n[TEXT] FPCSN embeds patient and community feedback into all aspects of service design and performance improvement through its Strategic Plan and Continuous Quality Improvement framework. Each health center operates a Community Advisory Committee composed of patients and local residents who meet regularly with site leadership to share experiences, identify community needs, and inform program priorities. Patient input is also collected through satisfaction surveys and patient town halls that provide opportunities for open dialogue. Data from these sources are analyzed quarterly by the leadership to identify trends and inform targeted quality improvement initiatives that address access, communication, and service delivery. At the governance level, FPCSN's Board of Directors, which includes 12 patient and community representatives, works with management to review patient feedback to guide strategic direction and ensure accountability to the populations served. Together, these structures create a continuous feedback loop where community voices shape priorities, inform CQI projects, and strengthen equitable, patient-centered care.\n\n[HEADING] RESPONSE\n\n[HEADING] 1. How Service Delivery Sites Will Support Access to Care\n\n[TEXT] FPCSN began 33 years ago in three converted apartments in a public housing development, and now consists of three fixed, permanent sites that provide all required and in-scope additional services: Abbottsford/Falls, the Health Annex, and the Stephen and Sandra Sheller 11th Street Family Health Services of Drexel University, as well as six smaller, seasonal school-based sites.\n\n[TEXT] 12\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 23 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 242645\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: N/A\n\n[HEADING] Family Practice & Counseling Services Network 2026 Service Area Competition Application\n\n[HEADING] a. Location of Service Delivery Sites\n\n[TEXT] Abbottsford/Falls Health Center 4700 Wissahickon Avenue Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19144\n\n[TEXT] The Abbottsford/Falls Health Center was the first FPCSN site and is co-located with the administrative offices of the FPCSN. The site is now four blocks from the Abbottsford Homes Housing Development and 1.8 miles from the Falls Development. The site provides comprehensive services and has 12 examining rooms, 7 behavioral health rooms, 7 dental operatories, and additional staff space and break out space for behavioral health services, health and diabetic education, and group services. Patients who need assistance coming to the site, particularly those at Abbottsford Homes who have mobility difficulties, are helped to access Medicaid transportation or public transportation. The Rite Choice Pharmacy that contracts to manage the Network's Title X 340B pharmaceuticals and fills prescriptions for patients is located in a shop adjacent to the health center. Contract specialists provide podiatry, cardiology, physical therapy, and ophthalmology services on-site.\n\n[TEXT] 11th Street Health Center 859 North 11th Street Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19123\n\n[TEXT] The Stephen and Sandra Sheller 11th Street Family Health Services of Drexel University became part of the Network through a New Access Point grant at the time the facility opened in 2002. It had been in operation since 1998 in a smaller facility nearby. The 11th Street site is operated by FPCSN under an operational agreement with Drexel University College of Nursing and Health Professions. The 11th Street Health Center is located in an area of North Philadelphia that is known as the 11th Street Public Housing Corridor because of the concentration of public housing located there. There are almost 3,000 people living in four surrounding public housing developments, and many patients walk to the health center, which also serves as a community center. There is public transportation near the site. The 11th Street site has 16 exam rooms and 9 dental operatories and provides comprehensive services. Rite Choice Pharmacy has a location within the health center. Contract specialists provide podiatry, cardiology, and ophthalmology services on-site. Cooking classes and other services are also operated under private grants.\n\n[TEXT] Health Annex Health Center 6120 Woodland Avenue Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19142\n\n[TEXT] In 2003, FPCSN received a New Access Point grant and took on the operation of the Health Annex health center from the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing, which had operated it since 1995. The Health Annex is located in the Woodland Shopping Center, which is located between the two public housing developments in a densely populated low-income area, on a trolley line, and accessible by several means of public transportation. The site provides comprehensive services and has 16 examining rooms, 6 behavioral health rooms, and 6 dental operatories, as well as a fitness center and physical therapy. Contract specialists on-site provide podiatry, cardiology, physical therapy, and optometry services. A Rite Choice Pharmacy is located within the health center.\n\n[TEXT] 13\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 24 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 242645\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: N/A\n\n[TEXT] Family Practice & Counseling Services Network 2026 Service Area Competition Application\n\n[TEXT] School-Based Sites FPCSN at Building 21 High School 6501 Limekiln Pike Philadelphia, PA, 19138 FPCSN at CB High School 4101 Freeland Avenue Philadelphia, PA 19128 FPCSN at Belmont Charter Inquiry School 1301 Belmont Avenue Philadelphia, PA, 19104 FPCSN at Belmont Charter Network High School 311 North 19th Street Philadelphia, PA, 19103\n\n[TEXT] FPCSN at Bartram High School 2401 S. 67th Street Philadelphia, PA 19142\n\n[TEXT] FPCSN at Philadelphia High School for Girls\n\n[TEXT] 1400 W.

The school sites started in 2022 with a School-Based Services grant. They are permanent sites and are noted as seasonal because they are closed for a few weeks in the summer. They are open during school hours whenever the school is in session. The sites provide primary care, behavioral health, and enabling/health education services in collaboration with school nurses and counseling staff. Patients needing outpatient mental health, dental care, or specialty services are assisted to make appointments at one of the full FPCSN sites. Patients at the school-based sites have access to FPCSN 24 hours and they have access to the other FPCSN sites and services when school is not in session.\n\n[HEADING] b. How Barriers Are Addressed\n\n[TEXT] As noted above regarding each site, the FPCSN health centers are in locations that are accessible to public housing developments managed by the Philadelphia Housing Authority, either by walking or by public transportation. The school-based sites make care available to students in the place where they spend much of their time. Those sites, which do not provide dental and other specialty services, are within easy travel of the comprehensive sites. Patients with mobility difficulties or who must bring children to appointments are assisted to access transportation operated by their insurer, or provided transit passes to travel on public transportation. The hours noted are appropriate for the patient population. All three comprehensive sites have walk-in availability. Patients are able to make same-day appointments for urgent problems and appointments within 48 hours for non-urgent needs. All of the comprehensive FPCSN health centers are open 40 hours or more and have evening and Saturday hours to accommodate the needs and schedules of as many patients as possible. Hours are determined in consultation with the FPCSN Community Advisory Committees, taking into consideration the responses to patient satisfaction surveys, and are approved by the Board.\n\n[TEXT] 14\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 25 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 242645\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: N/A\n\n[TEXT] Family Practice & Counseling Services Network 2026 Service Area Competition Application\n\n[TEXT] Monday\n\n[TEXT] Tuesday\n\n[TEXT] Wednesday\n\n[TEXT] Thursday\n\n[TEXT] Friday\n\n[TEXT] Saturday\n\n[TEXT] Abbottsford/Falls\n\n[TEXT] 8:30-7:00\n\n[TEXT] 8:30-5:00\n\n[TEXT] 8:30-5:00\n\n[TEXT] 8:30-7:00\n\n[TEXT] 8:30-3:00\n\n[TEXT] 8:30-12:00\n\n[TEXT] 11th Street\n\n[TEXT] 8:30-7:00\n\n[TEXT] 8:30-7:00\n\n[TEXT] 8:30-5:00\n\n[TEXT] 8:30-7:00\n\n[TEXT] 8:30-3:00\n\n[TEXT] 8:30-12:00 1 st/3rd\n\n[TEXT] Health Annex\n\n[TEXT] 8:30-6:00\n\n[TEXT] 8:30-7:00\n\n[TEXT] 8:30-6:00\n\n[TEXT] 8:30-6:00\n\n[TEXT] 8:30-6:00\n\n[TEXT] 8:30-12:00\n\n[TEXT] School Sites\n\n[TEXT] 7:30-5:00\n\n[TEXT] 7:30-5:00\n\n[TEXT] 7:30-5:00\n\n[TEXT] 7:30-5:00\n\n[TEXT] 7:30-5:00\n\n[TEXT] Closed\n\n[HEADING] c.

Provision of Required and Additional Health Services\n\n[TEXT] FPCSN has used an integrated model to deliver primary care provided by nurse practitioner, behavioral health, dental, and preventive services providers, along with other team members. The FPCSN model is a psychosocial, interdisciplinary approach that \"wraps its arms\" around patients. FPCSN's health centers provide all of the required primary care services, as well as integrated and outpatient behavioral health, dental, and wellness services. All of the services on Form 5A are provided directly, except for radiology and intrapartum care, and are described below in roughly the order they are found on the form.\n\n[HEADING] a. Access to Required and Additional Services by All Age Groups\n\n[HEADING] General Primary Medical Care, Screenings and Immunizations\n\n[TEXT] Pediatric and Well-Child Services: Well-baby and well-child visits, including height and weight and developmental assessments; immunizations; lead levels and other diagnostic testing; vision and hearing screens; dental screening; screening for family distress; and parent education, are provided directly in all of the FPCSN comprehensive health centers. All FPCSN providers have training regarding screening for family violence, whether against children or among partners in the home. Children and their families receive counseling either integrated with their primary health visits or through outpatient services on-site. Children receive almost all dental services in their center or referral to the nearest FPCSN comprehensive site. Children are referred to collaborating providers for diagnostic imaging and other higher-level testing, and for early intervention developmental and other specialty clinical services.\n\n[TEXT] Adolescent Services: Physical exams, including height and weight, vision and hearing screens, education regarding high-risk behavior issues (tobacco usage, sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy, substance abuse, use of seat belts), depression screening, and age-appropriate immunizations and labs for adolescents are provided in all of the health center sites, including the school-based sites. Adolescents and their families receive counseling either integrated with their primary health visits or through outpatient services at the comprehensive sites. They are referred to other providers for substance abuse treatment beyond what can be managed in outpatient counseling or through the FPCSN MOUD program. Adolescents who are patients in the school sites are referred for full dental care at the nearest comprehensive site. Young people are referred to collaborating providers for diagnostic imaging and other higher-level testing, as well as specialty clinical services.\n\n[TEXT] 15\n\n[TABLE] Table 5:\n | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | Saturday\nAbbottsford/Falls | 8:30-7:00 | 8:30-5:00 | 8:30-5:00 | 8:30-7:00 | 8:30-3:00 | 8:30-12:00\n11th Street | 8:30-7:00 | 8:30-7:00 | 8:30-5:00 | 8:30-7:00 | 8:30-3:00 | 8:30-12:00 1 st/3rd\nHealth Annex | 8:30-6:00 | 8:30-7:00 | 8:30-6:00 | 8:30-6:00 | 8:30-6:00 | 8:30-12:00\nSchool Sites | 7:30-5:00 | 7:30-5:00 | 7:30-5:00 | 7:30-5:00 | 7:30-5:00 | Closed\n\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 26 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 242645\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: N/A\n\n[TEXT] Family Practice & Counseling Services Network 2026 Service Area Competition Application\n\n[TEXT] Adult Services: All FPCSN comprehensive health center sites provide adult routine sick and health maintenance exams, including vital signs, height and weight; hearing and vision screens; immunizations as indicated; age-appropriate labs; prostate and breast exams and other cancer screens; and counseling/education regarding health issues such as weight management, nutrition, tobacco use, and substance abuse. Podiatry, cardiology, and optometry services are provided on site in the comprehensive centers through contracts and referral agreements. Behavioral health counseling, including psychiatric medication prescription, is provided either as part of primary care visits or through outpatient services. The large sites have psychiatric nurse practitioners embedded in primary care. Patients receive almost all dental services in their center. Mind/body services, such as massage, pain management, and yoga, are provided by FPCSN mind/body educators. Adults are referred to collaborating providers for diagnostic imaging, ultrasound, and other higher-level testing, and for specialty care, including inpatient and intensive mental health and substance abuse treatment. An area mobile mammogram van does periodic screenings at the health centers. An FPCSN HIV care specialist treats patients and consults with other FPCSN providers when they are caring for HIV-positive patients.\n\n[TEXT] Geriatric Services: Services for elderly people include routine adult services as noted above; immunizations as indicated; age-appropriate labs; functional assessments; counseling/education that includes home safety and osteoporosis prevention; and case management to assure patients have the services they need to remain safely and in good health at home.\n\n[HEADING] Diagnostic Laboratory and Diagnostic Radiology\n\n[TEXT] All of the FPCSN sites have laboratories that perform all in-house tests allowable by CLIA, in accordance with standards, including the school sites. Blood samples are drawn by health center staff and, for tests involving blood analysis that cannot be performed in-house, the samples are sent to designated managed care laboratories. In-house tests with immediate results include HbA1c levels and pregnancy tests, hemoglobin, strep, flu, and covid tests. Staff are trained in rapid HIV testing and brief counseling. Patients requiring x-ray services and other diagnostic procedures are referred to collaborating local hospitals, including CHOP and St. Christopher's for children and the Penn hospitals for adults.\n\n[TEXT] Family Planning, Gynecological, Prenatal, Obstetrical, and Postpartum Services\n\n[TEXT] Voluntary family planning, pregnancy testing, and routine gynecological care are provided on- site at all FPCSN sites, including those in the schools. FPCSN has a contract with the University of Pennsylvania Department of Family Medicine & Community Health (Penn Medicine) for the on-site provision of prenatal and obstetrical care and deliveries are managed in the Penn hospitals. Patients are referred to Penn Medicine for specialty gynecological services and prenatal services for women with high-risk pregnancies. Postpartum care is provided in the comprehensive health center sites.\n\n[TEXT] Preventive and Additional Dental Services\n\n[TEXT] The first Network Dental Center opened in December 2004 in the 11th Street site.

The services provided in the FPCSN dental centers include cleaning and root planning and scaling for patients of all ages, and topical fluoridation and sealants for children. Restorative services such as composite and amalgam fillings are provided, as well as emergency services to relieve pain such as extractions, nerve removal, and abscess care.

FPCSN has at least one full-time certified dental hygienist position at each site to provide comprehensive periodontal hygiene care, preventive services, and follow-up and outreach services when needed. Dental services are fully integrated with the primary medical care provided by the health centers. Screening is done for oral cancers, so that they can be detected as early as possible and treatment can be integrated with the primary care providers and specialists. FPCSN has grant funding available through which uninsured patients receive root canal and other procedures.\n\n[TEXT] Efforts are made to bring primary care patients into dental services. Through the \"Happy Visits\" program, children who come in for well-child visits, women who come in for prenatal visits are encouraged to go to the dental department on the same day as their visit and are seen on that day whenever possible. Mothers of infants are educated in ways to care for their babies' teeth and the importance of doing so. FPCSN has partnered with the MCOs to hold well-child days that include visits in both primary care and dental services.\n\n[TEXT] Full dental services as described here are planned in the budget for this SAC. Currently, only one FPCSN dental clinic is operating because the upheaval and uncertainty of the separation from RHD and loss of FQHC status caused many of the dental staff to leave and seek positions elsewhere.\n\n[HEADING] Pharmaceutical Services\n\n[TEXT] The FPCSN health centers work to assure that all patients who do not have prescription coverage can afford necessary medications. FPCSN has long had an arrangement with the Rite Choice Pharmacy to manage health center medications through the 340B Federal Drug Pricing Program and provide these to patients. Rite Choice is continuing to provide patients with discounted medications partly supported by FPCSN's Title X 340B Program. Rite Choice provides integrated pharmacy services inside or adjacent to each of the comprehensive sites. The pharmacy manages medications purchased by health, packages and labels them for patients needing to have prescriptions filled, and charges patients $6.00, which is waived if the patient is unable to pay. FPCSN is a Title X grantee and has a contract with Access Matters of Southeastern Pennsylvania that provides funding for pharmaceuticals related to contraception, cervical cancer screening and screening and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases.\n\n[HEADING] Health Education and Nutrition Services\n\n[TEXT] Health and nutrition education are a major focus of the FPCSN health centers. The population served by FPCSN has high rates of diabetes and obesity and many are now being prescribed GLP-1 medications and need a significant amount education and support in their use. The nurse practitioners and the RNs in the primary care teams incorporate nutrition education into primary care visits. In addition, FPCSN plans to have nutritionists, including some who are certified diabetic educators, to work in all of the health centers. Nutrition services are also provided by Community Health Workers in patients' homes, when directed by the nurse practitioner responsible for primary care. In addition, FPCSN has food pantries and WIC is on-site at each of the three comprehensive sites to help address food insecurity.\n\n[HEADING] Outreach, Eligibility Assistance, and Case Management Services\n\n[TEXT] FPCSN has a community engagement department that works to develop and maintain relationships with diverse community organizations to assure the broadest possible awareness of the health center's services and collaboration to provide the most seamless service to the target communities. Outreach and Enrollment staff work in the community to assist people to\n\n[TEXT] 17\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 28 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 242645\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: N/A\n\n[HEADING] Family Practice & Counseling Services Network 2026 Service Area Competition Application\n\n[TEXT] find and connect with all health insurance coverage they are eligible for. These staff work with front desk staff and determine patients' eligibility for medical coverage when they come to one of the health centers without insurance. The health center also contracts with Fabric Health, a service that helps families apply for or renew public benefits and use their health benefits.\n\n[TEXT] FPCSN screens all patients receiving care for health-related social needs to determine their need for social and support services. Social Workers provide patients with referrals to a variety of community services, such as income support, employment assistance, in-home services, and Meals-on-Wheels and other types of food assistance. Social workers and front desk staff work with the primary care teams to follow up when patients miss appointments, through telephone calls, and outreach efforts, as appropriate, with family members and significant others. These efforts are focused on determining the reasons for missed appointments and taking the steps needed to ensure that subsequent appointments are kept.\n\n[TEXT] There are Care Coordinators at each site who work with patients who have chronic conditions to assure they receive and required specialist care and that they are seen regularly to monitor their conditions. The Care Coordinators work with the primary care teams and with Community Health Workers to be sure that patients understand and are able to follow their medical regimens. They also follow up on patients who have had emergency room visits or hospitalizations to assure there is a plan in place to assure that they have the medications and supports they need and they are seen in the health center soon after their discharge.\n\n[TEXT] Transportation and Translation Services\n\n[TEXT] As noted above, the FPCSN population has a number of problems traveling to medical services, even in a large city with a transportation system. The public transit system has recently announced changes that will exacerbate these problems. Social service staff may provide patients with transit passes or help them access all Medicaid transportation assistance that is available to them. FPCSN also has an account with UberHealth to provide transportation for patients in urgent situations.\n\n[TEXT] FPCSN makes every effort to be sensitive and responsive to the linguistic issues presented by the people it serves. The FPCSN is compliant with federal requirements regarding Limited English Proficiency. FPCSN policy requires that no person will be denied access to services based solely on his/her inability to communicate aurally or orally in English. Each FPCSN site has Spanish speakers and there are staff who speak a number of different languages. Some referring organizations send translators with patients. The health center contracts with a language line for translators and interpreters for people with hearing deficiencies.\n\n[HEADING] Additional Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Services\n\n[TEXT] FPCSN has had an outpatient behavioral health department as part of its practice since its inception and FPCSN was among the first area FQHCs to integrate behavioral health services into primary care, beginning in 2008. Both integrated and outpatient BH services are provided on-site in the comprehensive sites and integrated services are provided in the school sites. Behavioral health services are provided by licensed clinical social workers and clinical psychologists, as well as psychiatrists. FPCSN psychiatric nurse practitioners provide medication management for depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, ADD/ADHD, schizophrenia, and schizoaffective disorder, working with both primary care and integrated BH providers.\n\n[TEXT] 18\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 29 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 242645\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: N/A\n\n[TEXT] Family Practice & Counseling Services Network 2026 Service Area Competition Application\n\n[TEXT] Integrated services are provided by Behavioral Health Consultants (BHCs) who work side-by- side with nurse practitioners, in the exam room, in all FPCSN sites. The goal of these Integrated Behavioral Health services is to develop and implement, within primary care, brief problem- focused treatment plans that include both medical and behavioral interventions focused on restoration of function and quality of life. Patients are taught behavioral strategies to help them adhere to medical regimens, new coping mechanisms, stress reduction strategies, and pain and/or disease management techniques. Patients receive behavioral health follow-up visits within the primary care area of the health center. Obtaining behavioral health in the same exam room where they receive physical health care normalizes the experience for patients, provides on-the-spot care in a familiar space, and dispels the stigma often associated with mental health care. Working with the BHCs, many patients are able to stabilize and manage both their behavioral health problems and their physical health. Integrated BHCs also provide screening for substance abuse using a specialized tool to assess whether screening, treatment, and referral for substance abuse in the primary care setting is the treatment option best suited for the patient.\n\n[TEXT] FPCSN has a Medication for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD) program and five providers are able to prescribe Vivitrol and Suboxone. When patients present for MOUD treatment, they are connected with the FPCSN program, or another organization through the Office of Behavioral Health if there is reason to do so, such as the need for detox. When the patient receives MOUD treatment with an FPCSN primary care provider, at each visit they see a BHC who coordinates the multiple services that people using mental health or substance use services often need, including the mind/body, pain management, nutrition, social work, and other integrated services available within FPCSN.\n\n[TEXT] Patients with serious behavioral health conditions and with substance use disorders that require treatment that is more intensive than can be addressed by the health centers are referred to local organizations that provide intensive and/or in-patient services, including:\n\n[TEXT] · Charter Fairmount Behavioral Health System and Friends Hospital for psychiatric inpatient and partial hospitalization services;\n\n[TEXT] · Fairmount Behavioral Health System for acute and subacute inpatient psychiatric, detoxification, rehabilitation, short- and long-term residential, and outpatient chemical dependency and methadone maintenance services;\n\n[TEXT] · Gaudenzia for short- and long-term residential, and outpatient chemical dependency services; and\n\n[TEXT] · Horizon House for Intellectual and Developmental Disability, Behavioral Health, and Homeless Services.\n\n[HEADING] Services by Referral\n\n[TEXT] FPCSN has contract arrangements with psychiatrist, podiatrist, and cardiologist providers, as well as a referral agreement with a physical therapy provider, under which these specialists are provided with space and referrals in the health centers, with the understanding that they will serve patients who are uninsured using the FPCSN sliding scales. In addition, pulmonology, oncology, endocrinology, orthopedics, urology, pain management, neuropsychology; ancillary services, such as audiology; emergency services; and other specialty services are provided through referral to nearby collaborating hospitals and other providers.\n\n[TEXT] 19\n\n[TEXT] Funding Opportunity Number: HRSA-26-004 Received Date: 10/24/2025 5:10:43 PM\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 30 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 242645\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: N/A\n\n[HEADING] Family Practice & Counseling Services Network 2026 Service Area Competition Application\n\n[TEXT] b. Access to Services Not Provided In-Person at all Sites\n\n[TEXT] The three FPCSN comprehensive health center sites directly provide all required services, except diagnostic radiology and intrapartum services, and all in-scope additional services. There are some services that are shared among sites. For instance, the lead HIV specialist is located at the Abbottsford Falls but sees HIV patients from all FPCSN sites via telehealth. Some patients may be referred to see her there or she may consult with the patient and/or the primary care provider at another site virtually if her expertise is needed. Many outpatient behavioral health visits are virtual, including those for substance use disorder care, and many patients prefer virtual services. Patients in the school-based sites receive primary care, family planning, and integrated behavioral health care on site. Those needing dental care or outpatient behavioral health services are assisted to make appointments at one of the comprehensive FPCSN sites. Patients at the school-based sites, like all patients, have access to FPCSN 24 hours and they have access to the other FPCSN sites and services when school is not in session.\n\n[HEADING] c. Provision of Services To Maintain and Improve Patient Health\n\n[TEXT] FPCSN provides the patient-centered chronic disease prevention and management, preventive health services and education, cancer screening, nutrition, mental health, and patient support services that many patients require to overcome barriers to their health. The health center focuses on preventive services and health education, assisting patients to understand what is needed to maintain health and avoid chronic illness. The primary care providers and teams of additional staff provide integrated care that includes health education to patients who need it. They are encouraged to have cancer screenings and live a healthy lifestyle to maintain their health. Patients may receive services from Social Workers, Care Coordinators, and/or Community Health Workers to help them connect with exercise and other services in the community, understand their medical regimens, and shop for and prepare healthy meals. Patients are encouraged to manage chronic illnesses to prevent worsening of their conditions. The health center uses connective devices such as blood sugar monitors, pulse oximeters for patients who are asthmatic, Bluetooth-enabled blood pressure cuffs, and dopplers for pregnant patients to support patients in these efforts. The health center's integrated and outpatient mental health, Medication for Opioid Use Disorder, and extensive enabling services, including health education, case management, transportation assistance, and translation, are described in detail above. Last year, a quarter of the health center's patients received integrated and/or outpatient behavioral health services and almost a third received at least one enabling service.\n\n[TEXT] In addition to the individual and family behavioral health services described above, FPCSN often provides group support services targeted to specific areas of need. All of these groups are available to all members of the community, whether or not they are health center users. These group services take place periodically and have included a variety of health-related groups, such as grandparents raising young children facilitated by a social worker from a partnering organization, SOWN (supportive older women's network) groups, Drug and Alcohol Recovery Groups, breast cancer survivor groups, Dialectical Behavior Therapy groups, and creative arts groups facilitated by an LCSW and mind-body educator to provide support for women who have experienced violence.\n\n[TEXT] Additional patient support services are described in e. below.\n\n[TEXT] 20\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 31 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 242645\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: N/A\n\n[HEADING] Family Practice & Counseling Services Network 2026 Service Area Competition Application\n\n[HEADING] d. Support of Care Continuity and Coordination, and Clinical Effectiveness\n\n[TEXT] The FPCSN approach to patient care is built on a foundation of continuity, clinical effectiveness, and patient-centered care coordination. To ensure continuity, each patient has a dedicated care team, consisting of a primary care provider, a nurse, and a medical assistant, who serve as a consistent point of contact for all their health needs. Clinical effectiveness by using evidence- based clinical guidelines for chronic disease management and a unified electronic health record that gives all care team members access to patients' complete medical histories. Peer reviews are conducted to monitor how patients are being treated. Patient-centered care coordination is the key to patient care. A personalized care plan is developed in collaboration with each patient, factoring in their health goals, health-related social needs, and preferences. The care coordinators follow up with patients after appointments, help them schedule specialist visits, and connect them with community resources. The care coordinators follow-up with patients who are due for cancer screenings and assist them in navigating getting these done. They also follow up with patients who have had emergency room visits or hospitalizations to ensure there is a follow up plan in place for them to see their FPCSN provider or a specialist, that they understand and are taking their medication, and that they have a support system in place from family or community nursing services. This integrated model ensures our patients receive not only timely and effective treatment but also feel supported and empowered throughout their care.\n\n[TEXT] e. Provision of Patient Support Service to Address Health Related Social Factors\n\n[TEXT] FPCSN recognizes that achieving optimal health outcomes requires a holistic approach that extends beyond clinical care. The health center is committed to addressing the diverse needs that impact a patient's health status, ensuring that services enabling access to care, comprehensive health and nutrition education, and case management are integrated into service delivery. All FPCSN patients are screened for health-related social needs that may be barriers to their use of services or barriers to improvement in their health. Enabling staff use the information gathered to make referrals as needed to a variety of community services, such as in-home services and Meals- on-Wheels, to provide support for patients in the community. In addition to these enabling services, which are also described above, the FPCSN sites have food pantries and WIC is on-site at each of the three comprehensive sites to help address food insecurity.\n\n[TEXT] FPCSN has had legal services available to patients for a number of years under an agreement with the Legal Clinic for the Disabled, which places a lawyer part-time in each of the three comprehensive sites. This Medical-Legal Program is particularly helpful when patients have issues with their landlord and their housing. The lawyer assists patients with other legal issues that are barriers either to their ability to receive or use health care or to overcome civil legal issues that are causing stress and hindering their ability to be well. The lawyer provides brief advice, options counseling, representation or further referral for a range of civil legal issues, including protection from abuse, Supplemental Security Income, Social Security Disability Insurance, Medical Assistance, and child custody/support.\n\n[HEADING] f. Provision of Patient-Centered Care\n\n[TEXT] The FPCSN approach to care is based on the provision of patient-centered care, ensuring every individual receives services tailored to their unique needs and goals. The health center is committed to empowering patients through comprehensive health education, providing them with the knowledge and resources to make informed decisions and actively participate in their health services. A key component of this strategy involves regular huddles, where the integrated\n\n[TEXT] 21\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 32 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 242645\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: N/A\n\n[HEADING] Family Practice & Counseling Services Network 2026 Service Area Competition Application\n\n[TEXT] care team reviews the status of all patients, including whether they are actively engaged in care or have been lost to follow-up care. These huddles allow the team to proactively identify and address barriers to care, develop targeted solutions to re-engage patients, and ensure no one falls through the cracks. The team works with patients in a collaborative process that facilitates the implementation of a comprehensive care plan that is not only clinically sound but also aligns with the patient's personal preferences and circumstances, ultimately supporting them in achieving their long-term health goals.\n\n[HEADING] g. Additional Services that Address Other Unique Needs\n\n[TEXT] FPCSN uses a psychosocial, interdisciplinary approach to care that \"wraps its arms\" around patients. Mind/body services, such as massage, pain management, and yoga, are provided by FPCN mind-body educators. Introduced in 2016, these complementary services were among the first provided in community health centers. Providers and all other staff receive training that helps them be sensitive to the difficulties many patients have experienced that affect their ability to connect to services and they refer patients to mental health or mind/body services to assist them.\n\n[HEADING] 3. Expansion of Access to Additional Services\n\n[TEXT] The focus of FPCSN services is on wellness and, given the prevalence of chronic illness in the communities served, management of these conditions. The nurse practitioners and the RNs in the primary care teams incorporate health and nutrition education into primary care visits. In addition, FPCSN plans to have nutritionists, including some who are certified diabetic educators, to work in all of the health centers. Nutrition services are also provided by Community Health Workers in patients' homes, when directed by the nurse practitioner responsible for primary care. In addition, FPCSN has food pantries and WIC is on-site at each of the three comprehensive sites to help address food insecurity. The health center partners with the Drexel College of Nursing and Health Professions for nursing students to provide health and chronic disease education. Because many patients come to care with low incomes and food insecurity, health education is provided that includes nutrition and how to prepare healthy food on a budget, and how to manage multiple health care providers and regimes. Integrated services include behavioral health, either brief interventions or longer-term therapy; case management to assist with health- related issues that may be barriers to care, legal services, group services that provide education and peer support, and complementary services to reduce stress. FPCSN continues to expand access to comprehensive care through strategic partnerships that extend services beyond traditional health delivery. Guided by its Strategic Plan and CQI framework, the Network prioritizes collaboration and innovation to meet the needs of communities across Philadelphia.\n\n[TEXT] The FPCSN Community Engagement Manager leads partnership development with community-based organizations, public housing authorities, schools, and faith-based groups to co-design enabling services such as behavioral health integration, perinatal support, nutrition programming, health education, and mobile outreach. These collaborations enhance referral pathways, strengthen care coordination, and increase access for residents facing social and geographic barriers to care. The FPCSN Board of Directors, which includes community representatives, advances these efforts by leveraging civic, philanthropic, and institutional relationships to align resources and sustain growth. Through key partnerships with the Philadelphia Housing Authority, School District of Philadelphia, Fabric Health and Health Federation of Philadelphia, FPCSN continues to expand behavioral health, preventive care, and social support capacity.\n\n[TEXT] 22\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 33 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 242645\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: N/A\n\n[HEADING] Family Practice & Counseling Services Network 2026 Service Area Competition Application\n\n[HEADING] 4. Maintenance of Supplemental Services\n\n[HEADING] a. Current Provision and Plans for Continued Services\n\n[TEXT] Expanded Cancer Screening: FPCSN was awarded Accelerating Cancer Screening (AxCS) funding in 2024 to increase colorectal cancer screening and referral in collaboration with the Spectrum FQHC, the Philadelphia Health Federation and its HCCN, and the Penn Abramson Cancer Center. The partnering organizations are focusing on the unscreened patient population of the participating health centers, comprising approximately five thousand residents of Philadelphia, who are predominantly low-income, African American, and experience multiple barriers to health care services. Through centralized use of population health management systems, the project team developed outreach lists for mailings that include patient education and a FIT kit, thus enabling a broad, efficient approach to addressing gaps in preventive screening. Text messages informed by behavioral science encourage patients to use the FIT kits and mail back their tests. The health centers' systems are being used to track and follow-up on results. The Cancer Center supports the health centers with expertise in mailed FIT campaigns as well as through a contracted Navigator who provides intensive, personalized services to patients who have a positive FIT and need colonoscopy and possible follow-up care. Through this methodology, the partnering organizations expect to double rates of colorectal cancer screening. The project is testing the viability of centralized, technology-enabled outreach for cancer screening, in order to support enhanced capacity for navigation services in FQHCs.\n\n[TEXT] b. New Applicant Plan to Ensure Access to Health Center Program-Funded Programming As noted above, the health center has been providing health care services in the service area for 33 years. Because the previous awardee changed ownership and relinquished the grant on 6/30/25, the FPCSN health center has had to establish a new non-profit corporation and apply as a new applicant for the area it has served for many years. This SAC application is being submitted to ensure that patients continue to have access to the services FPCSN provides, including those the Health Center Program has provided funding in the past to establish or expand. FPCSN has gathered tremendous support from the community. FPCSN has been able to keep all main and sites and the school sites open while providing all required services. Understanding it will be some time before the health center again has FQHC status and supports, the Penn hospital system, a major health-focused foundation, the area insurers, PACHC and the Health Fed, local civic leaders, and the state are all supporting and assisting the health center through this period in order to maintain FPCSN services and support our patients.\n\n[HEADING] 5. Sliding Fee Discount Program\n\n[HEADING] a. Sliding Fee Assessment\n\n[TEXT] FPCSN policy, approved by the Board, is that all required primary, preventive, dental, behavioral health, and additional health services are available and accessible to the target population without regard to patients' ability to pay, and that the health center has a sliding fee discount scale geared to U.S. poverty guidelines. Procedures dictate screening is conducted to determine all patients' eligibility for services under the sliding scale during the initial intake and annually. FPCSN ensures that patients are made aware of the sliding fee discount program by providing information on the website, signs in each site, and notifying patients during appointment scheduling and registration. To assess their eligibility for discounted fees, patients are asked to provide their family size and income information. Patients applying for the sliding fee scale discount program must present income documentation to determine income level that includes: previous year's tax return, current pay stub, pension check stub, beneficiary award\n\n[TEXT] 23\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 34 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 242645\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: N/A\n\n[HEADING] Family Practice & Counseling Services Network 2026 Service Area Competition Application\n\n[TEXT] letter (Social Security benefits, etc.), or personal attestation of earnings for people with no tax liability and/or who are self-employed. If patients do not have proper documentation with them, they are provided time to provide it for the discount to be applied to the visit. Once a discount has been approved, it is honored for a year, when the patient must reapply. Patients have the right to refuse to complete the assessment; they will be ineligible for discounts.\n\n[HEADING] b. How Patient Charges are Adjusted Based on Ability to Pay\n\n[TEXT] FPCN has sliding fee scales for Primary Care, Behavioral Health, Integrated Behavioral Health, and Dental services. The FPCSN sliding scales are revised annually and approved by the Board, include three categories between 100% and 200% of federal poverty level, and are used for all clinical services. (See the sliding scale in Attachment 10) The scales and procedures are on hand for staff who register patients and they receive training in how charges are adjusted according to health center policy. The scales are embedded within the EHR to automatically calculate the discounts once family size and income are entered. Attempts are made to collect discounted fees, but patients are not refused care as a result of non-payment. Hence, no one is denied services due to their inability to pay.\n\n[TEXT] c Sliding Fee Schedule Structure and Nominal Fees\n\n[TEXT] There are $20 nominal charges in place for patients with income below 100% of poverty for primary care services, which can be waived in some cases. These nominal charges are flat charges, they are not set at the actual cost of the service provided, and they are set at a level that is nominal from the perspective of the patient.\n\n[HEADING] d. Evaluation of Sliding Fee Discount Program\n\n[TEXT] FPCSN policy requires that the Board reviews, revises as needed, and approves the policy and supporting operating procedures, including the schedule of charges, and those regarding the billing and collections of patient accounts, on an annual basis. This review is designed to determine that, from the perspective of the patient, the sliding fee scales do not create barriers to service. The Board uses patient satisfaction surveys for this evaluation and seeks input from patient members on the Board and from the Community Advisory Committees regarding potential barriers the fees might pose for patients.\n\n[HEADING] 6. Care that is Respectful of and Responsive to Individual Needs\n\n[TEXT] a/b. Engagement of Patients in Care and Involvement with Families and Caregivers FPCSN services aim to improve patients' quality of life as defined by the individuals or families being served. Including families and caregivers in care, if the patient consents, is shown to increase health outcomes not only for patients but for families as well. It is critical that families are involved when appropriate to assist in strengthening the family unit through the services we provide. Goals for physical health, behavioral health, and meeting health related social needs are set with the patient and family, with a focus on what is important to them. Through discussion, providers and staff assure they fully understand the treatment options available and then that they understand details of the treatment regimen that is decided upon. If there are health-related social barriers to patients' receiving or implementing their treatment, such as needing to travel to a specialist, connect with food as medicine, or participate in exercise, referrals are made to assist patients with these needs. In some cases, behavioral health services are needed to help overcome barriers as well. Providers and all other staff have received training that helps them to be sensitive to the difficulties many patients have experienced that affect their ability to connect to services.\n\n[TEXT] 24\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 35 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 242645\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: N/A\n\n[HEADING] Family Practice & Counseling Services Network 2026 Service Area Competition Application\n\n[HEADING] c. Alignment with the Needs of the Underserved Area Population\n\n[TEXT] Since its inception over 30 years ago, the health center has been focused on increasing high quality integrated health care for those residents of the service area who are underserved as a result of their low-income status. FPCSN uses a number of ways to be sure that services are aligned with the needs of the communities served across Northwest, North, and Southwest Philadelphia and nearby Delaware County, areas experiencing high poverty, chronic disease, and limited access to care. Serving more than 15,000 patients annually, FPCSN provides comprehensive, integrated services including primary care, behavioral health, dental, perinatal, and enabling services that address social determinants of health.\n\n[TEXT] Formal needs assessments are done at least every three years, as well as when a new service or site is proposed either internally or by an external partner such as the Housing Authority, the PHA Tenants' Council, or the School District. Guided by its Strategic Plan and CQI framework, FPCSN uses population data, UDS metrics, and health screenings to identify gaps in care and target resources. FPCSN's Board of Directors, which includes community representatives, reviews outcome data to ensure operations remain responsive and equitable. There are a majority of patient members on the Board who provide valuable information about how the health center is doing in serving the community and each site has a Community Advisory Committee that helps the director and staff to keep in touch with community residents and partners and their ongoing needs. Through these coordinated strategies, FPCSN advances principles of accessibility and focus on community needs, ensuring all patients, regardless of income or background, receive high-quality and responsive care.\n\n[HEADING] 7. Process for Continuity of Care\n\n[HEADING] a. Communication Tools\n\n[TEXT] FPCSN is committed to ensuring that information on patient hospitalizations, including emergency department visits, is obtained and reviewed in a timely manner. The health center is part of the HealthShare Exchange (HSX) that provides the health center with real-time notice about health center patients who have been admitted to and discharged from participating hospitals for inpatient stays and emergency department visits. Staff have access to visit summaries that include prescription information and testing results, as well as the discharge summaries of FPCSN patients through area health systems electronic records. The health center works with area hospitals and other health providers in an integrated model of care, in that there are HIPAA-compliant arrangements for these providers to directly access the FPCSN EHR. Through the EHR, FPCSN staff receive information from the hospitals including lab and diagnostic results, and emergency care notes. Also, through the Azara population health management tool and the Aledade Accountable Care Organization FPCSN is a part of, the health center receives notifications of hospital and ER utilization that the Care Coordinators manage.\n\n[HEADING] b. Hospital Admitting\n\n[TEXT] FPCSN works with the hospitals in the service area to assure patients referred by the health center will be admitted. All of the hospitals offer emergency and diagnostic care and a broad range of medical specialties and services and most are teaching hospitals that have affiliations with local universities. A formal agreement is in place with the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania for referred patients to be admitted and have their care managed by hospitalists. Obstetric patients are accepted for inpatient delivery as part of the contracts in place with the Family Medicine group whose contract providers attend those patients and conduct medical rounds. These arrangements\n\n[TEXT] 25\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 36 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 242645\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: N/A\n\n[HEADING] Family Practice & Counseling Services Network 2026 Service Area Competition Application\n\n[TEXT] include an integrated model of care, in that the prenatal providers can access the FPCSN EHR for any needed information when a mother presents for delivery and delivery information, including the birthweight, is input directly in the patient's FPCSN chart. In all cases, information about patients' treatment and needs upon discharge is communicated to health center staff.\n\n[TEXT] c. Receipt, Follow-up, Recording of Medical Information from Referral Sources\n\n[TEXT] FPCSN staff receive information from the hospitals when patients visit the emergency department or are hospitalized directly into the EHR via the HSX HealthShare Exchange and via fax from the payers. Summaries are imported directly into the patient's chart by the Exchange and medications lists are updated. Staff then have access to visit summaries that include prescription information and testing results, as well as the discharge summaries of these FPCSN patients.\n\n[HEADING] d. Health Center Follow-up for Hospitalizations or ED Visits\n\n[TEXT] Most of the area hospitals send lab and diagnostic results, as well as emergency care notes, directly into the EHR. When patients are scheduled for discharge, they are given instructions regarding their medications, limitations on physical activity, and dates for follow-up care at the FPCSN and health center care management staff is notified electronically so that transition to outpatient care can be facilitated. An FPCSN care coordinator at each site follows up on all patients who have had emergency room visits or hospitalizations to ensure there is a follow up plan in place to see their FPCSN provider or a specialist, that they understand and are taking their medication, and that they have a support system in place from family or community nursing services. Social service staff makes referrals as needed to a variety of community services, such as in-home services and Meals-on-Wheels, to provide that support for patients in the community.\n\n[HEADING] 8. New Applicant Plan to Limit Disruption\n\n[TEXT] As noted above, the health center has been providing health care services in the service area for 33 years. Because the previous awardee changed ownership and relinquished the grant on 6/30/25, the FPCSN health center has had to establish a new non-profit corporation and apply as a new applicant for the area it has served for many years. FPCSN has been able to keep all main sites open while providing all required services in order to limit disruption and this SAC application is being submitted to ensure that patients continue to have access to the services FPCSN provides. FPCSN has gathered tremendous support from the community. Understanding it will be some time before the health center again has FQHC status and supports, the Penn hospital system, a major health-focused foundation, the area insurers, and the state are all supporting and assisting the health center through this period in order to maintain FPCSN services and support our patients.\n\n[HEADING] COLLABORATION\n\n[TEXT] 1. Collaboration with Partners to Increase Awareness of Community Health Needs Family Practice & Counseling Services Network has been a part of the fabric of healthcare in the Philadelphia area for many years. As noted above, FPCSN has strong working relationships with other health care, education, and service providers in the Philadelphia area to provide for sufficient and seamless services to patients and assure that there is awareness of the community's health and health-related needs. FPCSN has working relationships with a number of the health care and social service providers in the area, including collaboration with HIV/AIDS and infectious disease clinics and other Ryan White funded services, including Action Wellness, Mazzoni Health Center, Philadelphia FIGHT FQHC, and Neighborhoods United Against Drugs.\n\n[TEXT] 26\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 37 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 242645\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: N/A\n\n[HEADING] Family Practice & Counseling Services Network 2026 Service Area Competition Application\n\n[TEXT] The Abbottsford/Falls Health Center maintains an active presence in the Abbottsford Homes Housing Development. In addition to serving as a medical home for many residents, staff members work with the Philadelphia Housing Authority's community coordinators and partner organizations to provide community-based programming, including youth groups and events like the Holiday Drive. Abbottsford/Falls maintains relationships with local organizations to provide services to the community, including SOWN - a grandparents' resource and support group, Bridges to Wealth - a financial education program, Nice Roots Farm at the Share Food Program - fresh fruits and vegetables at affordable prices, the Food Trust, and Cradles to Crayons.

The FPCSN CEO has been on the PACHC Board of Directors and was Chairperson of the Policy Committee. FPCSN partners with the Association around advocacy for Pennsylvania FQHCs as well as for outreach and enrollment services.\n\n[TEXT] FPCSN is also a member of the Health Federation of Philadelphia and its Health Center Controlled Network. The HCCN helps the health center optimize its use of information technology tools and quality improvement efforts to improve patient care. The health center receives dashboards regarding the quality measures and aggregate health-related social needs\n\n[TEXT] 28\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 39 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 242645\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: N/A\n\n[HEADING] Family Practice & Counseling Services Network 2026 Service Area Competition Application\n\n[TEXT] data. Much of FPCSN's collaborative work takes place through the Health Federation, which sponsors training that all of the FQHCs use, operates joint purchasing services, and facilitates projects such as one to find additional ways to integrate behavioral health with primary care and one that trained medical assistants on advancing their role to improve quality of care outcomes. As noted above, letters of support are attached from both of these organizations.\n\n[HEADING] 4. Applicants requesting PHPC Funding\n\n[TEXT] a/b. How Public Housing Residents Are Involved in Planning and Ongoing Administration The FPCSN health centers have been created in partnership with the communities they serve and their services are reflective of community need and in partnership with the Philadelphia Housing Authority. The collaborative relationship with the Housing Authority has continued through the 33 years the FPCSN has been providing health services to public housing residents. The Network began in the Abbottsford Homes, a tenant-managed community, where the health center has always had a strong relationship with tenant leadership based on mutual respect. A resident of Abbottsford Homes was the President of the health center advisory committee for 26 years. The FPCSN Board members include one member who is a representative of the Housing Authority and two others who are or have been public housing residents.\n\n[TEXT] As noted above, each of the comprehensive FPCSN sites now has a Community Advisory Committee to help the site understand the needs and opinions of the community. The Network Community Engagement Manager facilitates Community Advisory Committee meetings at each site that include patients, including current and former PHA residents, recruited in partnership with PHA Tenant Councils, to ensure diverse community representation. She also leads quarterly patient town halls, creating an efficient communication platform where patients discuss new initiatives, service quality, and emerging needs. Insights from these meetings directly inform programming, outreach, and CQI priorities, as does the Strategic Plan. Through these coordinated strategies, FPCSN stays closely aligned with the needs of residents in Philadelphia Housing Authority communities through a coordinated model of care and community engagement. Through these structures, FPCSN integrates resident feedback into program design, resulting in initiatives like patient access, health education and outreach, perinatal wellness, and food security programs. This collaborative approach ensures that FPCSN services remain responsive, community-led, and aligned with the lived experiences of public housing residents.\n\n[HEADING] CAPACITY 1. Organizational Structure\n\n[TEXT] Family Practice & Counseling Services Network, Inc. is a 501(c)3 organization registered in Pennsylvania and listed with the IRS. The structure, management system, and lines of authority are appropriate to the delivery of high-quality care and are fully compliant with Section 330 requirements. As noted on the Organization Chart and Bylaws (Attachments 2 and 3), the organization is governed by a Board of Directors that elects its own members and exists to operate the FPCSN health center. The Board hires and evaluates the Executive Director/CEO. FPCSN has an Executive Team, Senior Leadership Team and Extended Leadership team that manage all aspects of the health center operations.\n\n[TEXT] a.

Subawards and Contractors\n\n[TEXT] FPCSN does not have a parent, affiliate, or subsidiary organization. It has no subawards, subrecipients, or contracts with any other organization to perform substantive programmatic work within the scope of project. FPCSN has contracts with the University of Pennsylvania Family Medicine for prenatal and obstetric care and with some other providers, but these are not substantial parts of the provider staff. All contracts and agreements include language indicating that no limit is placed on the health center's authority.\n\n[HEADING] 2. Management/Executive Team\n\n[TEXT] FPCSN has a very experienced Executive Team and the expertise and capabilities to manage the operation and oversight of the health center. All of the managers, including the CEO who is the Project Director, are hired directly. The FPCSN Chief Executive Officer reports to the Board and has responsibility for day-to-day operations, working with the Executive Leadership Team, which meets formally each week and includes the Chief Operations Officer (COO), the Chief Finance Officer (CFO), the Chief Clinical Officer (CD) , the Chief Compliance Officer, the Chief Strategy and Development Officer, and the Chief Human Resources Officer. A Senior Leadership Team that meets bi-weekly also includes the clinical directors for behavioral health, integrated behavioral health, and oral health, and the directors of the sites, and the Chief IT Officer (CIO).\n\n[TEXT] Emily Nichols has been the Executive Director of the health center since 2019. She was Director of Operations for six years and Director of one of the sites for three years before that. Her career has focused on Philadelphia-based FQHCs in a variety of roles centering on patient care, health outcomes, quality improvement, and patient-centered medical home recognition. She holds a BA in Public Health/Social and Behavioral Sciences from Johns Hopkins University and an MPH from Emory University with a concentration in Behavioral Sciences. Emily is dedicated to quality programming driven by population need and strives for outcomes that meet those needs in addressing the health-related social needs that can prevent engagement in health care services.\n\n[TEXT] Aaron Chavis is the FPCSN Chief Operations Officer. He holds a BA in Law and Justice from Rowan University and a Master of Public Administration from Florida State University and he has worked in the capacity of Interim Executive Director and Vice President of Operations over his career. Aaron manages FPCSN operations with the Center Directors and over 150 employees to ensure all programming is uniform and in keeping with the agency's principals and mission. The position of Chief Clinical Officer is vacant and the Clinical Director position is being filled on an interim basis by Jennifer Cohn, MD, from the Penn Department of Family Medicine and Community Health. She has provided obstetric and collaborative physician services for FPCSN for a number of years. The Chief Financial Officer position is held by Marcus Freeman who is a seasoned healthcare executive with more than twenty years of leadership experience within FQHCs and community-based healthcare organizations. The Chief Information Officer is Cheryl Rodenfels, who is also a consultant. She brings almost 20 years of IT service management and leadership, much of it in healthcare organizations.\n\n[TEXT] a. Management Team Support and Oversight of the Health Center\n\n[TEXT] The FPCSN Executive and Leadership Teams provide robust support for the operation and oversight of the health center and all of its programs by establishing a framework for policy implementation, accountability, and risk management. Regular supervision occurs for all staff with regular team meetings. To ensure accountability, the health center management uses the\n\n[TEXT] 30\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 41 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 242645\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: N/A\n\n[HEADING] Family Practice & Counseling Services Network 2026 Service Area Competition Application\n\n[TEXT] quality improvement process to implement a performance monitoring system that tracks key metrics related to patient care, financial stability, and operational efficiency. Comprehensive policies and procedures are followed and will be regularly reviewed to ensure compliance with federal, state, and local regulations. The Executive and Leadership Teams proactively address potential challenges through a structured risk management plan, which includes identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks to protect the program's integrity and long-term viability.\n\n[HEADING] b. Promotion of Innovation and Quality Improvement\n\n[TEXT] The FPCSN Executive Team promotes innovation and a culture of quality improvement and has worked to improve patient satisfaction, make technology enhancements to increase access to care, review staff compensation packages to be competitive and support staff retention, and enhance financial sustainability through added services and other funding opportunities. The team actively engages with the community to identify needs and develop responsive solutions, in particular through partnership with PACHC and the Health Federation and its HCCN. This engagement is also achieved through regular community needs assessments, patient satisfaction surveys, and staff feedback mechanisms. At FPCSN, innovations most often come from clinicians or other staff and they are always focused on improving the quality of health or life for patients and the community served. The Executive Team works with the Quality Improvement Committee that is tasked with analyzing data, piloting revised care models, and implementing evidence-based practices. Innovation has been fostered by allocating resources for pilot projects and encouraging an innovation mentality, where lessons learned from unsuccessful initiatives are used to inform future efforts. By creating an environment where feedback is valued and new ideas are encouraged, the Executive Team works to ensure the health center remains adaptable, effective, and truly responsive to the evolving needs of the community it serves.\n\n[TEXT] The FPCSN Strategic Plan and Continuous Quality Improvement Plan promote innovation and continuous quality improvement in the organization. These frameworks guide organizational priorities, align quality goals with community needs, and ensure evidence-based decision-making across all departments. Accountability for quality and innovation is embedded at every level. The FPCSN Board of Directors provides governance and oversees strategic direction and outcomes; the Executive Leadership Team provides strategic direction and ensures alignment throughout the Network; and the Senior Leadership Team (Department Leaders) manages implementation of performance and quality initiatives. The Extended Leadership Team that includes leaders across all FPCSN sites, meets monthly to review Network data, progress, and operational improvements. The CQI Committee meets quarterly to evaluate outcomes, monitor metrics, and update the CQI Plan. FPCSN's CQI process integrates patient feedback, survey data, and Community Advisory Committee input to inform service enhancements and pilot innovative care models. This structured, data-driven approach fosters accountability, transparency, and cross- departmental collaboration, ensuring innovation and quality remain central to achieving equitable, high-performing, and patient-centered care.\n\n[HEADING] 3. Recruitment and Retention of Qualified Providers\n\n[TEXT] When recruitment for management or provider positions is necessary, FPCSN uses all available avenues and tools to find the most qualified people and people who are motivated to work with the underserved patients and communities FPCSN serves. The health center assures that potential candidates are aware of the advantages of working for the Network, including the mentoring they will receive from the experienced leadership and providers, the opportunities they will have to\n\n[TEXT] 31\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 42 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 242645\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: N/A\n\n[HEADING] Family Practice & Counseling Services Network 2026 Service Area Competition Application\n\n[TEXT] participate in a nurse-managed model of care and with staff in a transdisciplinary model, the possibilities for flexible scheduling, and the funds available to support ongoing education.\n\n[TEXT] To encourage retention of managers and staff, FPCSN tries to pay salaries that are competitive in the market and offer an innovative plan of benefits, including a generous PTO package. Staff receive orientation and extensive training and continuing education, allowing them to earn Continuing Education credits. Clinical staff are provided time and reimbursement for conference expenses as the budget allows. Staff attend regular meetings that include case conferences and problem solving and support sessions, serve on committees such as CQI, and represent FPCSN on local and national committees. These activities ensure staff are as involved as possible in health center operations and decision-making to maximize their investment in the program and the work they and their colleagues are doing. FPCSN has had a recent initiative around the prevention of burn out and promotion of self-care, through which Mind-Body staff are available to staff as well as patients.\n\n[HEADING] 4. Financial Accounting and Control Systems\n\n[TEXT] In order to maintain its high degree of financial accuracy, FPCSN employs a solid financial management system. To assure that Generally Accepted Accounting Principles are followed, exacting internal controls are utilized, in that: 1) fiscal procedures are developed, continually updated, and stringently followed; 2) budgets are properly developed, approved, reviewed, and managed by a fiscal team; 3) all financial transactions are properly recorded and fully disclosed to all relevant parties; 4) all administrative costs are properly documented and periodically reviewed for their accuracy; 5) a professional audit of all fiscal matters is performed annually by a recognized outside auditing firm and reviewed by the FPCSN Board of Directors.\n\n[HEADING] a. Control Over Health Center Funds\n\n[TEXT] The FPCSN Chief Financial Officer acts to ensure that the activities of the health center are managed appropriately, run as efficiently as possible, are staffed appropriately, and ensure that GAAP standards can be maintained and FPCSN policies and procedures are followed. When necessary, the CFO recommends the need for policy and/or procedure change when that change enhances the efficiency of the department. The CFO works to ensure that the Financial Policies and Procedures meet all Federal, State, Government and Private guidelines, including federal payment management system requirements. This includes policies and procedures as they relate to grant funding as well as third party billing. FPCSN Policies specifically address IRS Filing, Audit, Insurance Coverage, Procurement, Internal Controls, Fee Schedules and Discounts, Billing and Collections, Budget and Accounting, Grants Management and staff travel. Accounting procedures maintain effective control over, and accountability for, all funds, property, and other assets.\n\n[HEADING] b. Tracking of Financial Performance\n\n[TEXT] FPCSN's accounting procedures maintain effective control over, and accountability for, all funds, property, and other assets and are in full compliance with federal, state and local regulations. They include the following specific accounting areas: check requisitions, invoices, accounts payable, accounts receivable, inventory, leases, cash receipts, payroll, benefits, and insurance. There is a comprehensive chart of accounts, ranging from wages and salaries to staff travel to property repair. Separate units have been established for each health center and clinical department, allowing revenue and expenses to be identified and directly charged to related programs. Effective segregation of duties represents a vital component to the organization's\n\n[TEXT] 32\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 43 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 242645\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: N/A\n\n[HEADING] Family Practice & Counseling Services Network 2026 Service Area Competition Application\n\n[TEXT] internal control system. Segregation of duties controls are designed and reviewed as an internal control to help prevent employees from committing errors or engaging in fraudulent activity. The system is under the supervision of the CFO who has long experience in complying with general accounting procedures. The system is sufficient to assure that all health center revenues are used solely for authorized purposes.\n\n[TEXT] FPCSN financial management activities are centralized, computerized, and readily accessible for audit and review. FPCSN utilizes AthenaPractice and VisDental practice management software, which have reports on revenue by source, aged accounts receivable by source, provider productivity, and encounters by payor category, among many other financial reports. In addition, monthly general ledger financial and budget reports allow management to analyze the organization's financial standing and trends. These systems allow FPCSN to enter and process demographic, clinical, and billing data. Patients can be identified by age, gender, zip code, income eligibility, family size, clinical services provided, insurance payer, and other demographics. Both practice management systems allow billed and actual payment to be reconciled. It also provides an accurate aged account receivable given the reimbursement processes of some organization funders. This system is key to many areas of patient billing as a threshold can be selected to initiate a follow-up or action. The system allows denials, cash payment cycles and other key operating indicators to be monitored. FPCSN is able to download billing and account receivable information directly into the current general ledger system to allow the finance department to perform reconciliations in a consistent and timely manner.\n\n[HEADING] c. Accounting for a 330 Award and Other Awards and Funds\n\n[TEXT] The financial accounting and internal control systems assure that all federal and other funds are fully accounted for, including maintaining source documentation, that all expenditures of funds are allowable, which will include Section 330 and other federal awards, and that only actual work performed is charged to each funding source. Funds received are tracked in separate general ledger accounts. Salaries and wages and other non-personnel costs supported by any funds are recorded in these separate general ledger accounts.\n\n[HEADING] d. Mitigation of Conflict of Interest\n\n[TEXT] To assure that decisions are free of bias, interest, or personal benefit or gain on the part of any member of the Board of Directors, Executive Team, or any other staff, FPCSN has a Conflict of Interests Policy, which states that \"No Board member, officer, employee, or agent shall participate in FPCSN's selection, award, or administration of any contract or grant when a real or apparent conflict of interest is involved\". The policy states that \"For purposes of contracting, a 'Conflict of Interest' arises when an employee, officer, director or agent, any member of his, her or their immediate family, his/her/their partner or an organization which employs or is about to employ any of those parties, has a financial, fiduciary or other interest in, and/or derives a tangible personal benefit from a firm considered by FPCSN for a contract\". The policy details the process by which conflicts will be determined and the process of recusal when a conflict exists. All Board members and staff must sign a Conflict Reporting Form at least annually confirming any conflicts of interest they may have or their non-conflicting status. The Conflict of Interests Policy is referenced in the FPCSN Procurement Policy that requires that all procurement transactions should be conducted in a manner to provide open and free competition and in the FPCSN Bylaws.\n\n[TEXT] 33\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 44 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 242645\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: N/A\n\n[HEADING] Family Practice & Counseling Services Network 2026 Service Area Competition Application\n\n[HEADING] 5. Planning for Disasters and Emergencies\n\n[TEXT] FPCSN has an Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan that outlines the health center's response to a disaster, including ways that patients would continue to receive care; how FPCSN would integrate its response with those of City agencies, area hospitals, and other medical providers; and how health center providers could be deployed to other organizations. An Emergency Response Team includes professional medical staff such as medical assistants, nurses and nurse practitioners, behavioral health staff such as therapists and crisis specialists, and some administrative personnel. The health centers will not be points of distribution for antibiotics, vaccines, and medical supplies; rather, staff will be deployed to city sites to assist in distribution. FPCSN will work with the City to integrate with its preparedness, conducting annual drills in coordination with the city if needed. FPCSN will have a plan for an emergency situation that is coordinated with the City's plan. The health center has insurance to prevent financial revenue and facilities loss in an emergency, as well as downtime procedures for each clinical department to ensure we can provide services in emergency situations. The Pennsylvania Forum for Primary Health Emergency Preparedness Manual, which is extensive, is the basis for the FPCSN Plan.\n\n[HEADING] 6. Factors Affecting Three-Year Trend\n\n[TEXT] The UDS reports filed over the last three years when the health center was operating as an FQHC indicated that the health center served 14,872 patients in CY2022, 15,214 patients in CY2023, and 15,617 patients in CY 2024. So, the trend has been upward since the pandemic. However, in the last twelve months, because of the upheaval and uncertainty of the separation from RHD and loss of FQHC status, many providers and other staff have left to seek positions elsewhere. As a result, further growth in the next year is not being projected in this application but as new staff are hired, FPCSN will increase the number of patients served.\n\n[HEADING] IMPACT/EVALUATIVE MEASURES\n\n[HEADING] 1. Quality Improvement and Quality Assurance Program\n\n[TEXT] The FPCSN quality improvement process is led by a Continuous Quality Improvement Committee that is headed by the Quality Manager and includes the CEO, the Primary Care Director and the Chief Clinical Officer, and the Department Heads from Integrated Behavioral Health, Outpatient Behavioral Health, Dental, Human Resources, and Finance. The CQI Committee is charged with enhancing the organization's performance by setting benchmarks, measuring progress made toward those goals, determining and implementing improvement plans when necessary.\n\n[TEXT] The purview of the CQI Committee includes four areas:\n\n[TEXT] · Oversight and compliance, including policies and protocols, staff credentials, the risk management program, emergency training, and the peer review process;\n\n[TEXT] · Quality Improvement and Quality Assurance, including internal controls and procedures, reports on performance on quality measures, identifying and analyzing areas identified for improvement, support of PDSA (Plan-Do-Study-Act) improvement cycles, and tracking patient and staff satisfaction;\n\n[TEXT] · Pay for Performance, Incentives, and Productivity; and\n\n[TEXT] · Financial Metrics.\n\n[TEXT] The Quality Manager, in partnership with Department Directors, is responsible for assuring that all staff, as well as Board and Site Advisory Committee members, are trained in the CQI process.\n\n[TEXT] 34\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 45 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 242645\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: N/A\n\n[HEADING] Family Practice & Counseling Services Network 2026 Service Area Competition Application\n\n[HEADING] a. Follows Clinical Guidelines and Standards of Care\n\n[TEXT] As noted above, FPCSN is recognized as a Patient Centered Medical Home. The health center has extensive operating procedures and clinical protocols in place that further this recognition. Evidence based guidelines and Clinical Decision Support tools are embedded in the electronic medical record, so that providers and staff receive prompts for patient care based on their diagnoses and services they provide. FPCSN has protocols in place regarding the care of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular health and risk reduction, cancer screening, screening for depression and behavioral health, prenatal care, women's health, infant immunization, and asthma. The Azara DRVS and i2iTracks population management software provides data reports regarding providers' adherence to these protocols and the outcomes for their patients in dashboards that include individual practitioner, clinic site, and health center results. These are used in supervision, site and health center management, and in the aggregate by the Board for decision making regarding the health center.\n\n[TEXT] The FPCSN Quality Improvement and Risk Management Procedures indicate the processes to be conducted to maintain and continually improve the quality of care provided by the health centers. The providers conduct audits of each other's charts bi-annually, under the peer review procedure, during which they review practice performance for completeness of charting, accuracy of coding, and documentation of preventive care and activities satisfying quality of care measures as defined by the Network as well as HEDIS measures and other external benchmarks.\n\n[HEADING] b. Addresses Patient Safety\n\n[TEXT] FPCSN has an established incident reporting system whereby personnel are required to bring to the attention of appropriate administrative staff any incident that affects or threatens to affect the health and/or safety of any person associated with the health centers. Procedures exist that detail any external parties that must be notified, such as for suspected child abuse or neglect, and how such notice should occur. Incidents reported are reviewed in the CQI Committee. Adverse incidents are reviewed by the Primary Care Director and the Executive Director, along with other managers and supervisory staff appropriate to the situation. Incidents provide information to be used in revision of processes, training of staff, and other actions that will increase the level of safety for patients and staff. All incidents reported are reviewed quarterly by the CQI committee and are assigned a red, yellow, or green status to indicate the severity of the incident. Sentinel events are incidents that result in harm, injury, or death to a patient or a person associated with the health centers. Sentinel events are investigated by the Primary Care Director and a thorough chart review is conducted with other clinical leaders if the affected person is a patient.\n\n[HEADING] Risk Management\n\n[TEXT] FPCSN has policies and procedures that govern its risk management processes, including those related to facility maintenance and inspections, monitoring of OSHA requirements, incident and accident response and review, fire and emergency drills, confidentiality and HIPAA compliance, and credentialing and privileging procedures. Each site has a written plan for dealing with fire and other life-threatening situations that details evacuation procedures, including how children or persons with disabilities will be assisted. The plans also indicate how management will be notified and the plan of action in case a site must be closed as a result of the crisis. Fire drills are held quarterly in each site, with at least one per year held when regular services for clients are being held. The CQI process monitors these processes and implements any quality improvement projects needed to assure that patients and staff are as safe as possible and that risk is minimized.\n\n[TEXT] 35\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 46 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 242645\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: N/A\n\n[HEADING] Family Practice & Counseling Services Network 2026 Service Area Competition Application\n\n[TEXT] FPCSN procedures cover employees' responsibility to notice and report any potential hazards in the health centers. Quarterly inspections are done by the Compliance Manager in each site to detect unsafe conditions, initiate preventive maintenance, and monitor actions on work required. Such inspections cover all aspects of facility safety, including OSHA, Department of Health, Fire Department, and ADA requirements and any other laws and regulations, including those requiring proper signage in the centers. Plumbing, ventilation, heating, cooling, lighting, fire extinguishers, and alarm systems are all included in the inspection process. Any problems discovered during the inspection process are addressed as quickly as possible. Any preventive maintenance needed is also noted and completed. All staff are expected to take all necessary safety precautions when operating health center equipment or securing the premises. Smoking is not permitted in the health centers or when staff are escorting patients or during outreach work.\n\n[HEADING] c. Improves Patient Experience and Satisfaction\n\n[TEXT] The FPCSN QI Plan indicates that annual patient satisfaction surveys will be conducted, but these actually take place much more often. Plans are underway to use the patient portal to conduct brief surveys after every visit. The results of these surveys are reviewed in the CQI Committee, which develops any needed quality improvement projects. The results of the surveys and resulting actions are shared with the site advisory committees, shared with health center staff, and put on the website to assure patients that the surveys are used and their voices are being heard. FPCSN has a Patients' Complaints and Grievances Policy that affirms patients' rights to voice grievances regarding their care, without recrimination, and to have those reviewed and, when possible, resolved. The procedure indicates that staff should encourage patients to make any issues they have with their care known and outlines how grievances are handled, including final decisions by the Executive Director and access to grievance mechanisms at the state and HRSA levels.\n\n[TEXT] d. Uses Electronic Health Record and Population Management System to Track Risk Factors FPCSN incorporated Centricity into the practice as an EHR and practice management system in 2005. The organization has regularly transitioned to more recent versions of the Centricity Practice Solutions system, converting the EHR to the certified meaningful use version. FPCSN system is now known as AthenaPractice. It is an integrated EHR and practice management system that fully supports the CQI process and is used to track clinical and financial data, providing information on both the clinical outcome measures for all life cycles and the financial goals of the program. The EHR has evidence-based practice standards embedded in the clinical decision support tool, so that those standards, as well as others that the provider staff chooses, can be used for CQI. The Dental Department uses VisDental, a Visualutions product that embeds into AthenaPractice so FPCSN has one EHR for patients using most of its services. Efforts are currently underway to bring behavioral health services into the EHR. This will allow seamless, integrated care for all patients accessing services along with one system for all reporting.\n\n[TEXT] The FPCSN AthenaPractice system contains a complete login and securitylaccess system to meet all HIPAA requirements; integrated MQIC reporting functionality and analysis for Meaningful Use patient care analysis; and reporting, patient registration, scheduling, billing and medical chart tracking in all ambulatory and primary care and behavioral health areas. It is backed by integrated quality reporting metrics, and serves as a self-contained, HIPAA-compliant and Meaningful Use certified product.\n\n[TEXT] 36\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 47 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 242645\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: N/A\n\n[HEADING] Family Practice & Counseling Services Network 2026 Service Area Competition Application\n\n[TEXT] Data collected is provided to the CQI Committee, which analyzes the information and makes plans for clinical and fiscal improvement. FPCSN uses Azara DRVS and i2iTracks, population management software that is directly connected to AthenaPractice. It is a unidirectional interface where EHR data feeds directly into Azara DRVS and i2iTracks, a population management software that is directly connected to AthenaPractice. Within Azara and i2iTracks, there is a host of data functionality:\n\n[TEXT] · Huddle reports that the primary care teams review daily that give an overview of patients scheduled for the day, clinical items due (cervical cancer screenings, vaccines due, etc.), protocols (ie, consider BHC visit for uncontrolled hypertension, or metformin for prediabetes)\n\n[TEXT] · Patient searches - list of patients with whatever criteria/filters are needed for functions such as recall or to create a tracking type, such as high-risk.\n\n[TEXT] · Reporting - all quality reporting for primary care and integrated behavioral health\n\n[TEXT] · Referral and Lab tracking\n\n[TEXT] · All UDS reporting, including UDS+ reporting through Azara\n\n[TEXT] As noted above, data is used by the CQI Committee, health center managers, and the board to design service improvements and guide decision-making.\n\n[TEXT] FPCSN collects data regarding health-related social needs from patients, using the Phreesia tool on tablet/iPads at intake for each visit for patient registration and to screen for depression and other mental health needs, substance use, and violence and other HRSN issues, such as any need for legal assistance or HIV testing, problems with access to an internet-connected device or Internet access, and a digital literacy assessment. FPCSN runs reports on what the patient population is experiencing and gaps in resources and uses this information to assure that services are meeting patient needs.\n\n[HEADING] 2. Improvement of Clinical Quality and Health Outcomes\n\n[TEXT] FPCSN is focused on the quality of the services provided to its patient population and on improving the health of the population of the area served. Standards for treatment for a number of chronic conditions are embedded in the EHR and preventive and treatment services and outcomes are reviewed through peer reviews and individual provider dashboards.\n\n[HEADING] a. Body Mass Index (BMI) Screening and Follow-Up Plan\n\n[TEXT] The population being served by FPCSN has a number of health-related social needs that are barriers to the maintenance of a healthy weight. The population largely lives in poverty, has a high prevalence of obesity, and lacks knowledge about and access to healthy food and many live in areas where it is unsafe to spend time outdoors exercising. FPCSN has an Overweight and Obesity in Adults Clinical Practice Protocol to give provider and patient teams need guidance and support to assure that medical care and follow up consistently follow evidence-based guidelines. The Protocol includes the requirement that all patients with BMI > 30 with or without co-morbidities are defined as high risk and referred to the RN Care Manager, the Behavioral Health Consultant, and the Nutritionist/Diabetic Educator who provides the nutrition/physical activity counseling. Patients with a BMI > 25 with co-morbidities are defined as moderate risk and referred to the above support staff as needed plus provided the nutrition/physical activity counseling. All BMIs > 25 and BMIs < 18.5 or 22 (per age group) are incorporated into the obesity-overweight/underweight dashboard and individual provider reports are provided to the providers on a quarterly basis to allow recall for any risk category as needed.\n\n[TEXT] 37\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 48 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 242645\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: N/A\n\n[HEADING] Family Practice & Counseling Services Network 2026 Service Area Competition Application\n\n[TEXT] Many patients have difficulty following through with their care plans and need additional counseling and support to follow the regime to manage their weight. The Nutritionist and/or diabetic educator make outreach/recall efforts with patients with moderate or high risk who have not been seen in at least a quarter. They are encouraged to come in for care and ongoing counseling regarding their care plans. Healthy eating is a priority for FPCSN. One site initiated a Food Access in the Community Team (FACT) group and partnered with Philabundance to become a food distribution site and now food pantries and WIC are on-site at each of the three comprehensive sites to help address food insecurity.\n\n[HEADING] b. Breast, Cervical, and Colorectal Cancer Screenings\n\n[TEXT] FPCSN was awarded Accelerating Cancer Screening (AxCS) funding in 2024 to increase colorectal cancer screening and referral in collaboration with the Spectrum FQHC, the Philadelphia Health Federation and its HCCN, and the Penn Abramson Cancer Center. The partnering organizations are focusing on unscreened patients of the participating centers, including over five thousand Philadelphia residents, who experience multiple barriers to health care services. Through centralized use of population health management systems, the project team developed outreach lists for mailings that include patient education and a FIT kit, thus enabling a broad, efficient approach to addressing gaps in preventive screening. Text messages informed by behavioral science encourage patients to use the FIT kits and mail back their tests. The health centers' systems are being used to track and follow-up on results. The Cancer Center supports the health centers with expertise in mailed FIT campaigns as well as through a contracted Navigator who provides intensive, personalized services to patients who have a positive FIT and need colonoscopy and possible follow-up care. Through this methodology, the partnering organizations expect to double rates of colorectal cancer screening. The project is testing the viability of centralized, technology-enabled outreach for cancer screening, in order to support enhanced capacity for navigation services in FQHCs.\n\n[TEXT] FPCSN has a Women's Health Clinical Practice Protocol to give provider and patient teams guidance and support to assure that medical care and follow up consistently follow evidence- based guidelines. The Protocol includes a workflow that dictates all women with appointments for family planning who have not had timely Pap tests or mammograms will have Pap tests set up in the exam room before the provider comes in. Those who need mammograms will receive a referral to their imaging center of choice. FPCSN has a Women's Health team, consisting of a women's health NP and a medical assistant, who recall women who have not come in for Pap tests as needed and rotate among the Philadelphia sites to conduct these. Patients often resist these tests and do not understand the importance of screening. Since the time recommended between tests has increased, some patients forget about them. Patients who are due for testing receive outreach/recall messages to schedule tests. FPCSN is learning from the formal work being done around colorectal screening and will apply that learning to Pap testing as well.\n\n[HEADING] c. Diabetes and Hypertension Control\n\n[TEXT] The population being served by FPCSN has a number of health-related social needs that are barriers to the maintenance of a healthy weight and the management of diabetes and hypertension. The population largely lives in poverty, has a high prevalence of obesity, and lacks knowledge about the dangers of their condition. There is also a lack of knowledge about advances in diabetic treatment such as weekly injections that can help patients more easily manage their disease. It has also been demonstrated that stress can contribute to poor\n\n[TEXT] 38\n\n[TEXT] Funding Opportunity Number: HRSA-26-004 Received Date: 10/24/2025 5:10:43 PM\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 49 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 242645\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: N/A\n\n[HEADING] Family Practice & Counseling Services Network 2026 Service Area Competition Application\n\n[TEXT] cardiovascular health and increased blood pressure. FPCSN is committed to being a pioneer at the forefront of identifying and amplifying effective community-level interventions for diabetes and blood pressure control. FPCSN is working to address social needs as part of its approach to controlling these conditions and educating patients on the impact they have on physical health.\n\n[TEXT] FPCSN has a number of resources available to assist individuals in need of help in controlling their weight, their blood pressure, or their HbA1c levels. The FPCSN Clinical Practice Protocols for Diabetes and Hypertension give provider and patient teams guidance and support to assure that medical care and follow up consistently follow evidence-based guidelines. A \"Diabetes Distress Scale\" is used to assess barriers patients are facing in controlling their diabetes and tailor interventions to meet their needs. BHC involvement has increased with uncontrolled diabetics who have co-morbid behavioral health needs. Guidelines detail counseling to be provided by the medical providers and when patients are referred to the Nutritionist, Diabetes Educator, and/or BHC staff. Patients are treated by a team that helps them develop and carry out care plans and services may be extended to their homes and communities through CHW staff. Likewise, patients with blood pressure over 180/110 with or without co- morbidities are defined as high risk and referred to the RN Care Manager to identify barriers to care, and to the BHC and Nutritionist/Educator for services. All diabetic and hypertensive patients are incorporated into the dashboard and reports are generated for the providers quarterly to allow recall for any risk category as needed. Any patient who has not had follow-up within six months, or three months for moderate risk, receives outreach messages to encourage them to come in for care. These efforts have been expanded to all three comprehensive sites and to prenatal patients as well.\n\n[TEXT] FPCSN has been part of a national pilot program with the Million Hearts initiative, focused specifically on reduction of blood pressure in the African American community, to pilot a community-level intervention focusing on understanding of hypertension risks and how to prevent cardiovascular events. Healthy eating is a priority for FPCSN. One site initiated a Food Access in the Community Team (FACT) group and partnered with Philabundance to become a food distribution site and now food pantries and WIC are on-site at each of the three comprehensive sites to help address food insecurity.\n\n[HEADING] d. Screening for Depression and Follow-Up Planning\n\n[TEXT] FPCSN has had behavioral health counseling in place since the inception of the health center and has been a pioneer in the integration of behavioral health services with primary care. FPCSN has a Depression Screening Clinical Practice Protocol in place to give provider and patient teams guidance and support to assure that care and follow up consistently follow evidence-based guidelines. Behavioral Health Consultant services are embedded in primary care to provide additional assessment, brief intervention, and referral to more intensive services. Psychiatric Nurse Practitioners are also embedded in primary care at our three comprehensive sites for patients who are in need of medication management. Patients can be referred by these BH providers or their primary care provider to FPCSN Outpatient located within the three comprehensive sites and will soon be available in the Mill Creek site as well. Outpatient services are provided by clinical psychologists, licensed professional counselors, psychiatric nurse practitioners, and licensed clinical social workers, as well as psychiatrists.\n\n[TEXT] Screening for depression, other mental health issues, and substance use issues is completed on tablets every six months as part of the FPCSN registration system. This has significantly increased the number of patients screened and identified for intervention. Managers are working to\n\n[TEXT] 39\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 50 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 242645\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: N/A\n\n[HEADING] Family Practice & Counseling Services Network 2026 Service Area Competition Application\n\n[TEXT] proactively identify patients screening positively on the tablets so that they provide an intervention during the same days' visit. The medical assistants are trained to be aware of patients' use or reluctance to use the questions on the intake screening and to respond appropriately. Most outpatient behavioral health services are being provided remotely at this time and the health center has found that this meets the needs of a number of patients, addressing the reluctance of some to use mental health services because of stigma or concerns about confidentiality. Some patients are more comfortable using these services while in their own environment.\n\n[HEADING] e. Tobacco Use Screening and Cessation Intervention\n\n[TEXT] FPCSN has a Tobacco Screening and Cessation Clinical Practice Protocol to give provider and patient teams need guidance and support to assure that medical care and follow up consistently follow evidence-based guidelines. The Clinical Practice Protocol that creates a consistent approach in screening/cessation and prompts MAs to screen tobacco use during triage/intake. They set out literature about cessation counseling when a positive screen is found and thus prompt provider completion of cessation counseling.\n\n[TEXT] f. Weight Assessment/Counseling for Nutrition and Physical Activity for Children and Adolescents Many families served by FPCSN have difficulty helping their children to follow through with their care plans and need additional counseling and support. The nurse practitioners in primary care provide children whose weight is above or below a healthy level with counseling about healthy nutrition and physical activity. FPCSN has an Overweight and Obesity in Children/Adolescents Clinical Practice Protocol to give provider and patient teams need guidance and support to assure that medical care and follow up consistently follow evidence- based guidelines. A Nutritionist and/or diabetic educator may make outreach/recall efforts with patients with moderate or high risk who have not been seen in at least a quarter. They will be encouraged to come in for care and ongoing counseling regarding their care plans.\n\n[HEADING] GOVERNANCE\n\n[HEADING] 1. Governing Board Reflection of the Community and Engagement with Patients\n\n[TEXT] As noted in Form 6A, 50% of the 12 members of the FPCSN Board of Directors are current users of the health center's services. One member is a representative of the Housing Authority and two others are or have been public housing residents. Most of the members live and/or work in the service area and several have expertise in community engagement. The patient Board members report on their experiences as patients, from the time they walk into the health center and encounter the person registering them through checkout, allowing management and fellow members to get accurate feedback on patient appointments. All of the Board members are active members of the community and they seek out people in the area to assure they are aware of the health center and to learn of any concerns there might be about services provided. Those who are not patients share their experiences and the opinions they gather outside of the health center.\n\n[HEADING] 2. Effective Board Governance\n\n[HEADING] a. The Board Leverages Members' Expertise\n\n[TEXT] All but one of the FPCSN board members live and/or work in the area served and they include individuals with expertise in law, public relations, education, community engagement, and healthcare operations and strategy. The Board members are eager to share their expertise and their input is welcomed by management as well as their fellow Board members. The Board's varying expertise will guide FPCSN strategic direction through program design, community\n\n[TEXT] 40\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 51 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 242645\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: N/A\n\n[HEADING] Family Practice & Counseling Services Network 2026 Service Area Competition Application\n\n[TEXT] engagement, and public health initiatives. At each Board meeting, there is a discussion of sharing resources among board members that could be utilized at the health centers.\n\n[TEXT] b. The Board Provides Oversight and Strategic Direction\n\n[TEXT] The FPCSN Bylaws indicate the Board is responsible for strategic planning and monitoring of program progress on those plans. The needs assessment of the service area community and the ongoing collaboration with the Housing Authority and other community partners are used by the Board for strategic planning. The information provided to the Board for strategic planning includes information on the health center's performance improvement activities, which include utilization and outcomes data. The members of the Board who are users of FPCSN services and those with connections in the community bring valuable information to this process. The Board utilizes the strategic plan as the blueprint for increasing and improving service to the community. The review of progress toward strategic plan goals, along with the reports from the CQI process, are mechanisms for the Board's use in its ongoing monitoring of organizational services, meeting the needs of the community, and patient satisfaction.\n\n[TEXT] c. The Board Evaluates Financial and Quality Performance\n\n[TEXT] The FPCSN Bylaws indicate the Board is responsible to evaluate the quality of the work of the health center and provide for organizational stability and compliance. The Board approves the fiscal year budget and CQI plan yearly. Quality Improvement reports, including progress on clinical and financial performance measures, incidents, and patient and staff satisfaction, are made to the board quarterly. The Board receives regular updates on the CQI process, which allows them to be aware of patient outcomes and satisfaction and any incidents that pose risk to the organization. The FPCSN management and the Board work closely together to manage the finances of the health center. The fiscal management policies and procedures have been approved by the Board and are reviewed annually. Monthly reports are provided to the CEO and are reviewed during regular management meetings and Board meetings. This financial information is used for decision-making regarding programs, staffing, and monitoring of the Financial Performance measures.\n\n[TEXT] 3. Native American Tribe Applicants - NA\n\n[TEXT] 4. Competing Supplement Applicants - NA\n\n[TEXT] 5. Public Agency Applicants - NA\n\n[HEADING] SUPPORT REQUESTED\n\n[TEXT] Complete budget materials for the year of the project period are included in this application, as are the staffing and income analysis forms. The budget assumptions are reasonable, given the number of users and the number of billable visits, as well as the severity of the health problems experienced by the people being served. The number of patients projected to be served is the same as the number listed as the SAAT patient target. The budgeted expenses, including salaries, benefits, and other supply and administrative costs, are reasonable for the size of the health center and the volume and types of services to be provided. Salaries and fringes represent half of the overall expenses. FPCSN is operated in a way that maximizes non-grant revenue and leverages other resources, particularly patient service fees and 340B funds, for health center operations. The percentage of federal grant dollars in the overall budget has always been reasonable and was 19% of the budget in the most recent year.\n\n[TEXT] 41\n\n[TEXT] Funding Opportunity Number: HRSA-26-004 Received Date: 10/24/2025 5:10:43 PM\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 52 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: N/A\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 242645\n\n[TEXT] Skip to Main Content\n\n[TEXT] SF-424A: BUDGET INFORMATION - Non-Construction Programs\n\n[TEXT] OMB Approval No. 4040-0004 Expiration Date 8/31/2016\n\n[TEXT] SECTION A - BUDGET SUMMARY\n\n[TEXT] Grant Program Function or Activity\n\n[TEXT] Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Number\n\n[TEXT] Estimated Unobligated Funds\n\n[TEXT] New or Revised Budget\n\n[TEXT] Federal\n\n[TEXT] Non-Federal\n\n[TEXT] Federal\n\n[TEXT] Non-Federal\n\n[TEXT] Total\n\n[TEXT] Residents of Public Housing\n\n[TEXT] 93.224\n\n[TEXT] $0.00\n\n[TEXT] $0.00\n\n[TEXT] $4,341,273.00\n\n[TEXT] $30,550,650.00\n\n[TEXT] $34,891,923.00\n\n[TEXT] Total\n\n[TEXT] $0.00\n\n[TEXT] $0.00\n\n[TEXT] $4,341,273.00\n\n[TEXT] $30,550,650.00\n\n[TEXT] $34,891,923.00\n\n[TEXT] SECTION B - BUDGET CATEGORIES\n\n[TEXT] Object Class Categories\n\n[TEXT] Federal\n\n[TEXT] Non-Federal\n\n[TEXT] Total\n\n[TEXT] a.

For more than 33 years, FPCSN has been a vital presence in Philadelphia's healthcare landscape, first as a Federally Qualified Health Center as part of Resources for Human Development, and now as a standalone non-profit Community Health Center. Throughout this legacy of providing care, FPCSN has consistently upheld the standards and requirements of the HRSA Health Center Program, providing essential care to communities across Philadelphia.\n\n[TEXT] Recent analyses confirm the significant unmet need for primary care in West/Southwest and North Philadelphia, where the FPCSN service area is located. In 2023, the Federally Qualified Health Centers served just 38.7% of the population in these neighborhoods, leaving an estimated 298,000 individuals without access to care through a community health center.

These neighborhoods face deep disparities in chronic disease, preventive care, oral health, and behavioral and prenatal services.\n\n[TEXT] At Project HOME, we see this unmet need daily. FPCSN's integrated model-offering primary, behavioral, oral health, and wellness services-greatly expands the local safety net and reaches patients who might otherwise go without care.\n\n[TEXT] Our longstanding partnership with FPCSN, through the Health Federation of Philadelphia and PACHC, reflects our shared mission to deliver healthcare with dignity.

This funding would support FPCN's dedication to providing care in their community through primary, behavioral, and oral health services.\n\n[TEXT] FPCSN is a network of federally qualified community health centers that use a nurse-managed, integrated model to deliver coordinated care for the entirety of the patient. For more than three decades, FPCSN has stood as a trusted partner in advancing community health across Philadelphia and continues to advocate for access to affordable, high-quality care.\n\n[TEXT] There is a well-documented need for this type of comprehensive, coordinated care that FPCSN provides; the communities they serve face disproportionately high rates of chronic disease, significant gaps in prenatal and preventive services, and ongoing barriers to accessing essential healthcare.\n\n[TEXT] With this grant funding, FPCSN can also strengthen outreach and care coordination, ensuring that uninsured and underinsured patients remain connected to continuous, comprehensive services rather than falling through the cracks of the healthcare system. Additionally, the funding would enable FPCSN to provide comprehensive care to uninsured patients who would otherwise go without critical primary, behavioral, and oral health services.\n\n[TEXT] I urge you to give the application full and fair consideration. Feel free to contact my office (202) 224-4254 if you have any questions, comments, or concerns. Thank you in advance for your consideration.\n\n[TEXT] Sincerely,\n\n[TEXT] John Fetterman United States Senator\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 121 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 242645\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: N/A\n\n[TEXT] JOANNA E.

As you know, my office has partnered with, and worked alongside FPCSN for years, advocating for access to affordable, high- quality care that citizens of Philadelphia and beyond deserve. This shared commitment has helped bring resources into neighborhoods where need is the greatest, and where too many residents would otherwise go without timely primary, behavioral, or oral healthcare. As we continue to look for ways to increase access and affordability across the board, I would like to thank FPCSN for the vital work your organization has done in Philadelphia on these fronts.\n\n[TEXT] The health challenges in our area are well-documented - high rates of chronic disease, gaps in prenatal and preventive services, and persistent barriers to care. The General Assembly is working hard to address each of these in our area and across Pennsylvania, but we cannot do it alone. We need partners such as FPCSN to help our residents get the care they expect and deserve. Despite our shared efforts, gaps persist.\n\n[TEXT] Consider that area Federally Qualified Health Centers recently served just 40% of the population in these vulnerable neighborhoods, leaving an estimated 395,214 low-income people unserved, including 61,812 uninsured residents. The Service Area Competition represents not only the continuation of FPCSN's vital work but also the fulfillment of the vision we have collectively championed, that quality healthcare is a right, not a privilege. In 2025, healthcare access should not be dependent on an individual's zip code.\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 122 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 242645\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: N/A\n\n[TEXT] Page 2\n\n[TEXT] FPCSN's integrated model of care, including its school-based health centers and community partnerships, reflects the kind of innovation and collaboration that strengthens our city's safety net, at a time when many in our community are dealing with a number of issues including access to health services and food insecurity. Your organization's mission directly aligns with our role as civic leaders: to improve the wellbeing of the people we represent, to ensure accessible healthcare services, and to advocate for sustainable systems of care. While these challenges still remain, it is clearly evident that FPCSN's work is more vital and more necessary than ever before.\n\n[TEXT] For these reasons and many others, I fully support FPCSN's Service Area Competition application and would like to reaffirm my commitment to continued collaboration in advancing wellness for all in Philadelphia, our region, and commonwealth.\n\n[TEXT] Sincerely,\n\n[TEXT] Joanna & mache\n\n[TEXT] Joanna E.

It is the policy of FPCSN to uniformly apply fee discounts to all patients deemed eligible, based on the most recent Federal Poverty Guidelines.\n\n[TEXT] The FPCSN sliding scale is based solely on income and family size and is reviewed periodically regarding affordability. The definitions used in the policy for income and family are those of the US Census. Income is defined as all cash receipts before taxes with certain adjustments and does not include non-cash benefits such as SNAP, school lunch programs, clothing vouchers, or food/rent in lieu of wages. Family is defined as a group of two or more persons related by birth, marriage, or adoption who live together; students, regardless of residence, who are supported by their parents are considered to be living in same household. An individual living alone or in a household with individuals outside of their family is defined as a family of one.\n\n[TEXT] Sliding Fee Assessment\n\n[TEXT] FPCSN policy requires that patients are made aware of the sliding fee discount program by providing information on the health center website, posting signs in each site, and notifying patients during appointment scheduling and registration. Patients are asked annually to provide their family size and income information for an assessment of their eligibility for discounted fees. Patients applying for the sliding fee scale discount must present income documentation to determine income level that includes: previous year's tax return, current pay stub, pension check stub, beneficiary award letter (Social Security benefits, etc.), or personal attestation of earnings for persons with no tax liability and/or who are self-employed. If patients do not have proper documentation with them, they are provided time to provide it for the discount to be applied to the visit. Once a discount has been approved, it is honored for a year, at which time the patient must reapply. Patients have the right to refuse to complete the assessment; they will be ineligible for discounts.\n\n[TEXT] Sliding Fee Schedule Structure and Nominal Fees\n\n[TEXT] FPCN has sliding fee scales for Primary Care, Behavioral Health, Integrated Behavioral Health, and Dental services. The FPCSN sliding scales are revised annually and approved by the Board, and include three categories between 100% and 200% of federal poverty level, includes definitions of family size, and is used for all clinical services. (See sliding scale in Attachment 10) The scales and procedures are on hand for staff who register patients and they receive training in how charges are adjusted according to health center policy. The scales are embedded within the EHR to automatically calculate the discounts once family size and income are entered.\n\n[TEXT] Charges for patients with income below 100% of poverty are set at nominal levels that can be waived in some cases. The nominal charges are flat charges, are not set at the actual cost of the service provided, and are set at levels designed to be nominal from the perspective of the patient.\n\n[TEXT] 1\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 131 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 242645\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: N/A\n\n[HEADING] Family Practice & Counseling Services Network 2026 Service Area Competition Application\n\n[TEXT] The sliding scales go up to 200% of federal poverty level for most services and 250% for family planning services covered by a state program, and the scales are used for all clinical services. There is no charge for lab work for uninsured patients and it is included as a part of the primary care visit. Attempts are made to collect the discounted fees, but patients are not refused care as a result of non-payment. Hence, no one is denied services due to their inability to pay.\n\n[HEADING] KEY MANAGEMENT STAFF\n\n[TEXT] As noted in Form 2, the organization chart, the position descriptions, and the key management resumes attached, all of the managers, including the Executive Director who is the CEO, are hired directly by FPCSN. The Executive Director reports directly to the Board and the Board has the authority and responsibility for the selection/dismissal and evaluation of that position. The Executive Director is responsible to select and dismiss all personnel working in the health center and to assure there is a process for filling vacant key management positions. The Executive Director supervises the other members of the executive team and assures that Board policies are carried out.\n\n[HEADING] CONTRACTS AND SUBAWARDS\n\n[TEXT] As noted in the narrative, Attachment 7, and Form 8, Family Practice & Counseling Services Network is a private 501(c)3 organization registered in Pennsylvania and with the IRS. FPCSN does not have a parent, affiliate, or subsidiary organization. It has no contracts with any other organization to perform substantive programmatic work within the proposed scope of project, and no subawards to carry out any portion of the project.\n\n[TEXT] FPCSN financial accounting and internal control systems are designed to ensure that all federal funds are fully accounted for, including maintaining source documentation, that all expenditures of federal award funds are allowable, and that only actual work performed is charged to any award. Federal funds received will be tracked in a separate general ledger account. Salaries and wages supported by federal funds will be recorded in these separate general ledger accounts, while other non-personnel costs are reported in a separate cost center.\n\n[HEADING] COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIPS\n\n[TEXT] As noted in the narrative and Attachment 9, FPCSN coordinates and integrates its activities with other health services in the service area, consistent with those noted in Attachment 1. The health care community in the Philadelphia area solidly supports the new entity operating the health center.\n\n[HEADING] BILLING AND COLLECTIONS\n\n[TEXT] a. Participation in Medicare, Medicaid, Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) As noted in Form 3, FPCSN participates in Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP, and other insurers. It has contracts with all MCOs in the service area. FPCSN's eligibility determination process allows patients to have their insurance eligibility assessed prior to receiving services. The eligibility verification is completed via an Internet capability utilizing a combination of AthenaPractice eligibility, Promise (State Medicaid) Eligibility, and Navinet eligibility verification portals. The billing process involves claims being submitted to the payors utilizing the ANSI 837 standard format. The claims, automatically generated by the system, are reviewed manually by personnel for accuracy and consistency of coding. All billing is done in-house. Claims are submitted from the practice management system(s) to the payor, utilizing a\n\n[TEXT] 2\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 132 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 242645\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: N/A\n\n[HEADING] Family Practice & Counseling Services Network 2026 Service Area Competition Application\n\n[TEXT] clearinghouse, which in turn forwards the ANSI 837 file to the payor. The submission of the file is monitored from FPCSN's system to the clearinghouse and from the clearinghouse to the payor, as is the file for a claims acknowledgement from the payor. FPCSN has implemented a full EDI process for claims and reimbursement (including claims payment posting for about 75% of all payments) and is in the process of having all reimbursements where applicable done through electronic funds transfer.\n\n[HEADING] b. Patient Payment Collection and Waiver\n\n[TEXT] The FPCSN policy includes an Eligibility Determination process under which all patients have their eligibility for coverage checked prior to services being performed. Staff update each patient's insurance coverage at the time of the initial call for an appointment and also at the time of the reminder call. Upon the patient's arrival, the staff completes an eligibility verification. Some of the database systems in place are with the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services, the Medicaid MCO, Navinet, and various other Internet capabilities.\n\n[TEXT] FPCSN collections procedures require that patients are asked for applicable co-pays and sliding fee amounts at the time of services. Patients who indicate that they cannot pay the amount owed may have a payment plan established or may have the nominal fee waived, depending on circumstances. For patients who do not make payments at the time of service, statements are presented to them at the time of service and education is provided on additional elements such as payment plans, grace periods, and prompt payment incentives. Attempts are made to collect the discounted fees, but no patients are refused care as a result of non-payment. If a patient states they cannot pay, the patient meets with the Social Services Manager to better understand and overcome the patient's circumstances. If the patient cannot pay, FPCSN policy is that the fee will be waived. All patients are seen for the visit regardless of ability to pay.\n\n[HEADING] BUDGET\n\n[TEXT] Please see the FPCSN Budget Narrative attached to this application.\n\n[HEADING] GOVERNANCE\n\n[HEADING] Board Authority\n\n[TEXT] The By-Laws for Family Practice & Counseling Services Network, Inc. are attached (Attachment 2).

No individual, entity, or committee is noted as having authority or veto power over the Board and committees are specifically barred from amending the By-Laws or the Articles of Incorporation; selecting, approving, or dismissing Directors; or changing any resolution of the Board. There is no agreement or collaboration in place that restricts board authority.\n\n[HEADING] Compliance with Health Center Program Board Composition Requirements\n\n[TEXT] The Family Practice & Counseling Services Network Board is vested with full authority and responsibility for the operations of the health center. The By-Laws indicate in Article III that the FPCSN Board is to include between 9 and 15 members. In Article III Composition, the By-Laws indicate that at least 51% of members are to be patients of the health center and should include representation from public housing. Article III Composition also indicates that of the non-patient members no more than 50% may derive more than 10% of their income from the health care industry and they should be representative of the community, including public housing, and should have expertise in community affairs, government, finance, legal affairs, and other commercial and/or social services in the community. Article III Composition indicates that no Director may be an employee of FPCSN or an immediate family member (i.e., spouse, child, parent, or brother or sister through blood, adoption, or marriage) of such an employee.\n\n[TEXT] There are currently twelve members on the FPCSN Board, six of whom are FPCSN patients. One member is a representative of the Housing Authority and two others are or have been public housing residents. As noted on the Board list, Form 6A, the FPSN Board members have expertise in a number of fields, including law, public relations, education, community engagement, and healthcare operations and strategy. Three of the six non-patient members derive income from the health care industry.\n\n[TEXT] 4\n\n[TEXT] Funding Opportunity Number: HRSA-26-004 Received Date: 10/24/2025 5:10:43 PM\n\n\n\n========== PAGE 134 (from PDF footer) ==========\n\n[TEXT] EHB Application Number: 242645\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: N/A\n\n[HEADING] :selected: Form 1A - General Information Worksheet\n\n[TEXT] 00242645: FAMILY PRACTICE\n\n[TEXT] & COUNSELING SERVICES NETWORK INC\n\n[TEXT] Due Date: 11/05/2025 (Due In: 11 Days)\n\n[TEXT] Announcement Number:\n\n[TEXT] HRSA-26-004 Announcement Name: Service Area Competition\n\n[TEXT] Application Type: New\n\n[TEXT] Grant Number: Not Available\n\n[TEXT] Target Population: Residents of Public Housing\n\n[TEXT] Target Audience: Not Available\n\n[TEXT] Resources :selected:\n\n[TEXT] As of 10/24/2025 05:10:46 PM OMB Number: 0915-0285 OMB Expiration Date: 4/30/2026\n\n[TEXT] ₹1.

(maximum 1,000 characters)\n\n[TEXT] The health center has been providing health care services to residents of public housing and the surrounding communities in the service area for 33 years. Because the previous awardee changed ownership and relinquished the grant on 6/30/25, the FPCSN health center has established a new non-profit corporation and is applying as a new applicant for the area it has served for many years. In order to limit disruption in services to its patients, FPCSN has been able to keep all main sites open while providing the required services. However, in the last twelve months, because of the upheaval and uncertainty of the separation from the awardee and loss of FQHC status, many providers and other staff have left to seek positions elsewhere. Therefore, the requested federal funds will be used to add clinical provider staff to expand existing services so FPCSN can serve more patients with the service area.\n\n[TEXT] Funding Opportunity Number: HRSA-26-004 Received Date: 10/24/2025 5:10:43 PM\n\n",
