The Project Narrative, Section I.5.a states: 'CBWCHC conducts annual needs assessments of the patients and communities we serve and seek to serve, in an effort to better understand on-going and emerging factors that impact access to care, health care utilization and health outcomes. Needs assessment findings are presented to members of the management team and Board of Directors, which inform and help guide efforts to improve access to care and service delivery. The Board of Directors' Strategic Planning Committee uses CBWCHC's needs assessment studies to inform the development of CBWCHC's strategic plan every three years.'\n2. Section I.5.b further states: 'In addition to annual reviews of overall sociodemographic trends in CBWCHC's service area and population health trends throughout the service area and among CBWCHC's patient population, we also regularly conduct needs assessment studies that focus on more targeted concerns or populations.'\n3. Section I.5.c describes the use of patient and community input, including biannual patient experience surveys, quarterly patient relations committee meetings, and patient advisory meetings.\n4. Section I.1.e states: 'CBWCHC annually reviews and defines the boundaries of the catchment area that we serve, in compliance with Chapter 3 of the Health Resources and Services Administration's Health Center Program Compliance Manual (\"Compliance Manual\"). This process includes annually reviewing the zip codes from which active patients reside and conducting an annual needs assessment of the patients and communities CBWCHC currently serves and/or targets.'\n5. Section I.1.g and throughout the Needs Assessment section, the application provides updated population, demographic, and health status data (e.g., 2023 American Community Survey, NYC DOHMH 2024 reports, etc.), and describes recent targeted needs assessments (e.g., Asian American senior citizens, young adults 18-24).\n6.

The process involves both management and Board review, and findings are used for both short-term and long-term planning, including the triennial strategic plan. The application also describes targeted assessments for special populations and regular patient/community input. This meets and exceeds the HRSA requirement for Element b.",
