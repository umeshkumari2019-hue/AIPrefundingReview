Removal requires a 2/3 board vote. No other entity, committee, or individual has authority to select the board chair or a majority of board members. This is further supported by the explicit statement that passage of motions requires a majority vote of the board, and that no other entity has veto or approval power. This meets HRSA requirements.",
