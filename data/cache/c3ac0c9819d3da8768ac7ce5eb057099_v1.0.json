The needs assessment includes data on the general service area and special populations (e.g., MSAW), as shown in the narrative and in tables throughout the section.\n4. The application describes how the needs assessment informs service delivery, strategic planning, and scope updates (see narrative sections on annual review, zip code analysis, and strategic planning integration).\n5.
