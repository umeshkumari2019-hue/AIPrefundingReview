The application describes a 'triennial comprehensive review: Full CHNA synchronized with regional hospital CHNAs (St. Mary's and Piedmont Athens Regional) and County Health Rankings; includes stratification by age, sex, language, and income.' The application also states: 'The annual review integrates quantitative data and community input to ensure that MedLink's service delivery model continues to meet the changing needs of its 22-county region.' The Compliance Manual crosswalk (Attachment 13) states: 'The Needs Assessment identifies population demographics, chronic disease, mental health, food insecurity, and access barriers using CHNA, OASIS, and UDS data.
