          "evidence": "1. In the Project Narrative, under '5. Describe how you will: a. Conduct and update your needs assessment,' Agape Family Health (AFH) states: 'AFH will conduct and update its comprehensive needs assessment every three years, in alignment with HRSA requirements and the Health Center Program Compliance Manual. This triennial assessment ensures that AFH remains responsive to the evolving needs of the service area by systematically reviewing patient demographics, health status indicators, and community assets and gaps.'\n2. The narrative further states: 'This triennial assessment ensures that AFH remains responsive to the evolving needs of the service area by systematically reviewing patient demographics, health status indicators, and community assets and gaps. The needs assessment process incorporates a robust analysis of Uniform Data System (UDS) data, HRSA Data Warehouse statistics, Census information, and local public health sources to capture a current, data-driven picture of the populations served—including all special populations (such as MHC, HCH, PHPC) identified in the SAAT.'\n3. The Compliance Attachment 13 restates: 'AFH conducts a comprehensive needs assessment every three years, supplemented by annual reviews using Uniform Data System (UDS) data, community input, and local public health data.'\n4. The Project Narrative and Compliance Attachment 13 both describe annual reviews and interim updates as needed for significant changes.\n5. The Board of Directors is involved in reviewing the needs assessment to inform strategic planning and resource allocation.\n6. The needs assessment uses the most recently available data: 2024 UDS data, 2023 ACS, 2023-2024 local and state data, and references to current population and insurance trends.\n7. The needs assessment addresses the required populations, including special populations (homeless, agricultural workers, Opportunity Zones, etc.), and is used to inform service delivery and program planning.",
