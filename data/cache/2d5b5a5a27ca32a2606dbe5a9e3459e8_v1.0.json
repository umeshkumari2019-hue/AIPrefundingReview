          "evidence": "1. The application narrative (see '5. Describe how you will: a. Conduct and update your needs assessment') states: 'FRRH conducts a triennial comprehensive assessment informed by several data sources. Analysis includes data from UDS, American Community Survey and Population Estimate Program data, RWJF County Health Rankings, Maine's Department of Health and Human Services CHNA, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS), Maine CDC data, and data from local partners. Annually FRRH refreshes ZIP code and service mix to analyze to confirm where patients reside and the services that they need.'\n2. The Needs Assessment section includes detailed data tables and narrative using the most recent available data (e.g., 2025 Maine Shared CHNA, 2024 UDS, 2022-2024 population estimates, etc.).\n3. The application describes annual review processes and triennial comprehensive needs assessment, with explicit reference to informing service delivery and scope changes (e.g., expansion of dental services in response to MaineCare changes, new pharmacy services, etc.).\n4. The application provides evidence of use of the needs assessment to inform and improve delivery of services (e.g., expansion of school-based health centers, transportation services, food shelf program, etc.).\n5. The application includes a summary of changes since the last SAC application (2022), including population growth, changes in patient demographics, and service area needs, all supported by current data.\n6. The application describes the use of multiple data sources, including UDS, Maine Shared CHNA, GeoCare Navigator, and local partner data.",

The needs assessment is explicitly used to inform and improve service delivery, as evidenced by changes in scope and services described in the application.
