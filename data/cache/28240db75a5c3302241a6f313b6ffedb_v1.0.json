Article II Section 2.02 and Article IV Section 4.01 require the Board to hold regular monthly meetings and maintain minutes, demonstrating ongoing oversight. Article VI Section 6.01 gives the Board the authority to hire and dismiss the CEO, who is the principal administrative officer. The Compliance Narrative confirms there are no reserved powers for any outside entity, and the Executive Committee may only act on behalf of the Board in pressing issues, with all actions subject to full Board approval. The organizational chart shows the Board at the top of the structure, with the CEO and all key management reporting to it. The Foundation's bylaws (Form 8 Affiliate Attachment) specify that the Foundation does not have any reserve or veto authority over the Health Center Board. There is no evidence of any contract or agreement restricting the Board's authority. Therefore, the health center is compliant with maintaining Board authority over the Health Center Program project.",

The bylaws also require the Board to ensure compliance with federal, state, and local laws. The compliance narrative confirms there are no reserved or veto powers for any individual, entity, or committee, and the Executive Committee cannot supersede the full Board.
