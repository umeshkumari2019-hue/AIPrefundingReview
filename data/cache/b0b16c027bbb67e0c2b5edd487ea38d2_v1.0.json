The application describes the use of the most recent UDS data (2023, 2024, 2025 YTD), census data, state and local vital statistics, and other current data sources. The methodology section describes how the assessment is used to inform strategic planning and service delivery. The application also describes an annual service area review to identify needed changes, using the most recent UDS data and patient origin data. Special populations (e.g., persons experiencing homelessness, rural/frontier residents, persons aged 65+) are addressed throughout the needs assessment narrative.",
