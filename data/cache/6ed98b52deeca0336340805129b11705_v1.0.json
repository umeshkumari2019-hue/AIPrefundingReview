The needs assessment utilizes the most recently available data for the service area and, if applicable, special populations and addresses the following:",
          "evidence": "In the Project Narrative, under 'NEED', the application states: 'Primarily through its outreach/enabling staff and contractors, the SCAgWHP conducts needs assessments on a bi-annual basis. To ensure a comprehensive look at the specific needs of the community, the Program secures input from farmworker patients, their employers (growers/crew leaders), and like-missioned partners/interested individuals. Based on information gleaned from needs assessments, coupled with input from patient satisfaction surveys and the availability of funding, the SCAgWHP's Scope of Project is updated to provide additional services, as practicable.' Further, it references the use of the most recent UDS data, patient satisfaction surveys, and a population estimate study. The application also states that 'recent needs assessments resulted in heightened efforts in certain areas of the state—services that are already in-scope—as opposed to adding new services, while patient satisfaction survey results were utilized to improve the patient experience.' Additionally, the application notes that 'completion of bi-annual needs assessments and patient satisfaction surveys; ongoing communication with key gatekeepers and partners; securing input from members of the SC Agricultural Worker Health Advisory Council; and keeping abreast of the health care/policy landscape at the local, statewide, regional, and national levels' are used to assess and respond to the health care needs of the population.",
          "evidenceLocation": "Not specified",
          "reasoning": "The application provides clear evidence that the needs assessment is conducted at least every three years (in fact, bi-annually), uses the most recent available data (including UDS, surveys, and external studies), and informs the delivery of services (as evidenced by the addition of podiatry and chiropractic services and adjustments to service focus). The process includes input from patients, employers, and partners, and results are used for service planning and improvement. This meets the HRSA requirement for a regularly updated, data-driven needs assessment that informs program delivery.",

Fees charged to and collected from patients convey to the corresponding fee-for-service contractor, not to the Program. In addition, the Program is not a Medicaid, Medicare, or other public/private insurance provider. As such, the SCAgWHP does not have any patient related revenue.'
