          "evidence": "In the 'Needs Assessment and Scope of Project Methodology' section, the application states: 'SCHC conducts a CHNA every three years to inform and improve the delivery of health center services. SCHC times the completion of their CHNA to correspond with their SAC project period. This ensures that the assessment accurately reflects current state of the service area and target population when they complete their SAC application. SCHC's most recent CHNA was completed July 2025. The most recently available data for the service area and special populations, including the Uniform Data System reports, FLHealthCHARTS, the CDC WONDER data, and various public health and county planning reports, was utilized for the completion of this CHNA. In addition, a survey of patients was conducted to assess patient demographics, access to care, perceived health issues, preferred services, and experiences with the clinics and providers. Focus group interviews were also conducted with SCHC stakeholders, including administrative leadership, clinic physicians and nursing assistants, and Board Members.'",

The needs assessment uses the most recently available data from multiple sources (UDS, FLHealthCHARTS, CDC WONDER, county planning reports), and includes input from patient surveys and stakeholder focus groups, ensuring that it is comprehensive and data-driven. The assessment covers the current and proposed population, including special populations, and is used to inform and improve service delivery, as required by HRSA.
