          "evidence": "1. The Project Narrative, Section '5. Needs Assessment', states: 'TSCHC conducts periodic assessments of the needs of the rural service area and target population, which provides valuable insight and data into the process of informing and improving the delivery of health care services. The most recent TSCHC internal assessment of the target population's health care needs was conducted in preparation and planning for the development of this FY26 Service Area Competition application.'\n2. The narrative further states: 'Additionally, TSCHC is actively engaged in developing and implementing the CHNAs for Washington and Allegany Counties, MD, and Fulton County, PA.'\n3. The application references three independent Community Health Needs Assessments (CHNAs) conducted in 2025 by local hospitals and community partners (including TSCHC) in Maryland's Allegany and Washington Counties and Pennsylvania's Fulton County (all within TSCHC's service area).\n4. The application uses the most recent data available (2019-2023 American Community Survey, County Health Rankings 2022, CDC data up to 2023, etc.) throughout the needs assessment section.\n5. The needs assessment is used to inform service delivery, as described in the Project Narrative and in the section on strategic planning and Board review.\n6. The application describes annual reviews of service area and ongoing patient satisfaction surveys as additional mechanisms for needs assessment.\n7. The application includes detailed demographic, health status, and service utilization data for the current/proposed population, and discusses special populations (e.g., low-income, uninsured, Medicaid, Medicare, elderly, rural, etc.).",

The needs assessment uses the most recent available data for the service area and special populations, and is used to inform and improve service delivery. The process and results are reviewed by the Board and management, and are used for strategic planning and service development.
