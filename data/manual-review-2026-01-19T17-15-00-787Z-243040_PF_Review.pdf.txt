[TEXT] . Only applicable to health centers that choose to have a nominal charge for patients at or below 100 percent of the FPG: The setting of a flat nominal charge(s) at a level that would be nominal from the perspective of the patient (for example, based on input from patient board members, patient surveys, advisory committees, or a review of co-pay amount(s) associated with Medicare and Medicaid for patients with comparable incomes) and would not reflect the actual cost of the service being provided.

[TEXT] The HC received FY2023 H2E funding for School-Based Service Expansion. Per Project Narrative Response - Item 4a (p. 32), the grantee operates three School-Based Health Centers at an elementary, middle, and high school, each serving roughly three to six patients per day one to two days per week. Services provided include pediatric primary care, immunizations, sports physicals, BH support, and health education. In addition to an onsite medical provider, BH CHWs rotate between all campuses to provide outreach and support. As the program grows and visit volume increases, the HC plans to add an LCSW to provide advanced BH support and to increase provider availability at each campus.
