The needs assessment utilizes the most recently available data for the service area and, if applicable, special populations and addresses the following:",
          "evidence": "The Project Narrative and Project Abstract provide a detailed needs assessment of the service area (Weno Island, Chuuk State), including population demographics, health indicators, barriers to care, and health disparities, referencing data from the 2010 FSM Census, 2013/14 household income survey, 2011-2014 health statistics, and other recent sources. The application describes annual review of the service area, and the Board's intent to submit a New Access Point application for expansion. The narrative also discusses the process for ongoing needs assessment, including collaboration with public health programs and annual planning. The application states: 'How the service area is annually reviewed - The service area is the entire island and population of Weno; hence there is no opportunity to expand or adjust the service area of the existing health center without a New Access Point application to HRSA for the lagoon and/or outer islands, such as Faichuk or the Mortlocks. The CHCC Board of Directors anticipates submitting an NAP for Faichuk in the near future.' The MOA (Memorandum of Agreement) between CCHC and CDHS also includes a commitment to 'planning and implementing periodic community needs assessments to ensure services of CCHC are responsive and appropriate to the community.'",

The inclusion of annual review, collaboration with public health, and Board oversight further supports compliance. There is no indication that the assessment is out of date or missing required components. The MOA and narrative confirm ongoing and periodic updates. Therefore, the application is COMPLIANT with Element b - Update of Needs Assessment.",
